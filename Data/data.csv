Feeling like going mad,"I suffer from severe OCD, related to magic thinking, and over the past few days it has gotten very bad. I had felt this bad before, but I see no end to this. The coronavirus pandemic continues and triggers my OCD, I guess. It is not as if I am afraid of it, only for some time, but the atmosphere in the world is really making me feel sad. I had felt this way before, when some situation would trigger my anxiety and I would feel very bad, but after the situation is over, my OCD would return to normal, but only after some time. But this time the situation outside is getting worse or at least not getting better and there is no way the external world would help me return to normal. I feel like my mind is functioning way faster than usual, because if I usually get intrusive thoughts one after the other, then now I get them at a rate of 10 per minute. Everything seems to have sped up. I sometimes feel on the brink of madness. The anxiety and intrusive thoughts make any action hard; I cannot eat, read, sit, stand, walk, write, do whatever.

"Something Hopeful - Finally, I Am Officially Diagnosed","I want to write this for people who maybe need to read something that isn‚Äôt so toxic‚Ä¶

Today I was given the official diagnosis of OCD.

Since I can remember, I have been an anxious person, but I am not the type that shows it. Depression was there too, but sparse. That was until two years ago: when I got hit with an avalanche of depression and anxiety that shook my entire life. Over these two years, I have been to *six* different therapists and two psychiatrists; some helped; most didn‚Äôt do much. Unfortunately, that part of my story is all too common and is the crap reality many who seek help have to endure. Despite that, I still feel like the right help is possible. And yesterday my persistence paid off.

At the onset of my mental health collapse, I did a ton of personal homework on what was happening to me. I quickly found that OCD fit the bill, but I am no doctor. So, I went to medical professionals, asking them for help. Nothing. They would give me a ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù or ‚Äúit could be‚Äù only to send me off with drugs (four different ones) that never quite did it. They said I just had depression. It didn‚Äôt sit right. It didn't explain all these other symptoms I was/am experiencing. They made me feel stupid. I felt that maybe I didn‚Äôt know what I was talking about, until yesterday. Someone took me seriously and ran legitimate protocols to see if I fit anything. She told me I had OCD and was very much on the severe end of it. I laughed. She said: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I have ever seen anyone react quite that way before.‚Äù I told her, I felt vindicated. I showed her the books I read on OCD. The journals I kept. I knew early on what was happening and no one cared or wanted to be bothered enough to help me. Two years of pushing this shit uphill and finally someone took the time to analyze me and give me a proper diagnosis. It wasn‚Äôt that she cared. It was that she gave me an honest look and told me what I have known all along:

I have OCD.

Relief after speaking with therapist,"I went through ERP last year, and finished in December. One of my main themes was contamination, and I worked SO hard to get to a functional level. For the past few months I've been able to maintain my OCD pretty well, then BAM! All of the sudden, the CDC is saying we need to do all the things I get compulsive about. I've definitely felt like I've had a lot of backslide over the past few days, so I decided to start seeing my therapist (through telehealth) for the duration of the outbreak so I can keep managing it. 
At the end of our session, she said I'm actually handling it really well all things considered, and she doesn't think I've had as much backslide as I thought. As she pointed out, the current norm for cleanliness has changed, so even though I've increased my handwashing and cleaning, it's not as unreasonable as I thought. Some of it is getting into OCD territory, but it was a huge relief to hear that I havent undone all of the progress I've made! I'm going to keep seeing her until this is over just to make sure I continue to manage my compulsions, but I definitely feel better after today.

"I'm feeling like I'm going to make a mistake, let me know if you experience this same compulsion.","I may have already explained this particular compulsion but I'll explain again just in case. If anyone else deals with this, I'd love to know because I feel so incredibly isolated.

For as long as I remember, I've always compulsively cut my hair off. I had a very unstable childhood and one of the ways I coped was to frequently chop my hair into a short pixie in an attempt to feel in control. Usually every year or two (and sometimes even every six months) I'll suddenly have the unrelenting compulsion to cut my hair. I always feel as though I can't just ignore it. About eight months ago, I full on buzzed my head. I kept it for a few months (frankly I really enjoyed the style) and now I've been growing it out for six months.

Well, this afternoon I had the thought that I must buzz my head again. It's not because of the grow out phase, I've done this so many times that I'm not embarrassed about the awkward stages. I just really, really want to buzz my head again.

I feel as though I've already grown it out for so long that it'd be a waste to just get rid of it all. But the thought of ignoring this compulsion feels agonizing and like I won't be able to function until I use my hair clippers.

How can I tell if I'm actually having a compulsion vs just liking having a pixie?

What can I do? I want to cry because I have an electric razor in my closet so I could go into my bathroom right now and just get it done. I don't know how long I'd have to resist before the compulsion will shut the fuck up since I've only lasted five or six days before giving in.

I've been taking meds for OCD for about three months now and things were fine. Until they weren't.

OCD False memories and POCD of past mistakes

I'll keep it brief because I already made a similar post on Psychforums, but just really want ti get everything off my chest because the therapy doesn't help. I recently re-watched an episode of Black Mirror after a few years - I loved there episode when I first watched it and I wasn't really affected - and I started to worry and get extreme panic attacks.

The episode was Shut up and dance (if you watched the episode then you know where I'm going with this). The episode triggered a lost memory I had of my 13-15 year old self exploring different types of porn and coming across a lot of underage girls. I've been having a lot of intrusive thoughts and false memories of the events so I can't remember all the details but I remember visiting the images (I found them on google images) and masturbating to them multiple times. I saved a shit ton of them, as I do with all the porn I find, including instagram pics. 

I'm 16 now but remembering this event led me into a dark place I struggle to get out of, I keep getting false memories, obsessive thoughts, a shit ton of intrusive and thoughts that I kept me questioning myself as a person and a human being, and many curiosities on darker subject matter and wanting to explore. 

The worse thing for me was giving up my favorite hobby, watching movies, mostly because my memories and regrets spring back up whenever I see a child on screen or something relating to a pervert, rapist, peso, etc...

I was never comfortable around kids to begin with, mostly cause I feared I would be attracted to them or hurt them, but this whole experience worsened everything and I started to repetitively hit myself whenever I had the thoughts. I sometimes got turned on by one of the thoughts but that just led to me crying or having a panic attack.

  It has gotten so bad that my thoughts and my actual self are hard to separate, making me fear who I really am.

  I can't even masturbate to classmates or porn without having an urge or curiosity to look it up, or even images of kids which makes me feel more ashamed when I finish.

   I always fantasized about girls in my school, them being a lot shorter than I was, but I always replace the thought of them with a girl A LOT younger than me and it forced my to give up masturbating for a few days.

I was able to ignore the curious thoughts in my head sometimes but they always sprung up again after a while. The thoughts were mainly targeted towards finding more of the underage images and grotesque videos on the dark web just out of curiosity. I knew just viewing these would make my guilt, shame, and fear worsen. I keep getting night terrors and images of hurting or abusing children and infants. These don't help my migraines and also worsened my self-esteem and anxiety. 

   I was diagnosed with OCD and PTSD a while ago but it doesn't really help my thoughts and my curiosities.  I just hope to find someway to return to my normal self and continue my love for movies like before. 


The images I remember stumbling across were on google images and were, Silver Jewels, World Impression, Amazon girl nude, Teen lingerie, Barely Legal, Camgirl porn. ( A lot of them were titled Jailbait)


(Hey, I made a post with this exact test a few months ago but I‚Äôve feeling the same way again and I just feel like expressing it. I probably already mentioned it but I‚Äôll just do a brief summary just so my OCD can calm down. Ok so, I was 14-16, masturbated to young girls maybe ages 6-19 (I‚Äôm not sure if they were but my OCD self wont let it down unless I put the 6-19), fear of being arrested and or shamed by family, fear of ruining my future career, fear of being a pedo, fear of all things really. I would like to say I‚Äôm not a pedo but my OCD side always makes me feel guilty for stating facts. 

   I‚Äôm scared of using safari because of the fear of coming across images of girls that look young and how it will make me horny and repeat the whole cycle again. I really hope that I‚Äôm not a monster and I hope all of my thoughts are just thoughts and not possibilities. I try and rationalize things to make myself feel better about it but it always comes back in the end. I‚Äô d been having trouble sleeping and doing hobbies because of my lack of motivation and happiness. I hate going to sleep just because of the cycle. I hope I can find someone with a similar experience, I would like to think that I‚Äôm not a pedo just because I masturbated to girls I found attracted on google images. I just want to confess about all that. Hopefully I‚Äôm not a bad guy but then again I remember searching that up many times before.",OCD,1584593877,Lucy47-1,2,1,True,2020-03-19

Fear of mushrooms?,"Not sure if this is OCD related but it sounds like it could be. Maybe y'all experienced something similar.

I've had this long-term fear of mushrooms. Not the food kind, but the wild kind. I also get really skiddish when seeing ANY type of mushroom that has a big flat head. It could be online or offline.

&amp;#x200B;

Ironically, I really like the taste of mushrooms! I used to be able to go outside and pick mushrooms from the ground when I was little. I started being scared of them during middle school and I have no idea why. I can still eat them and seeing the rounder head ones don't bother me *too* much unless I find it in the wild at random.

When I see them, I freeze. I freeze, then freak out. Not being able to move without shaking. I started panicking one time while cleaning dishes because the greesey cheese looked like the flat mushrooms. It was so scary.  I will literally have  panic attack upon seeing a random mushroom growing outside. 

Not sure what this is associated with or why I'm afraid? Any suggestions/advice would be helpful. Would like to see if others feel similar.",OCD,1584597066,DearDefinition,1,1,True,2020-03-19
"Honestly, having OCD has made this crisis unimaginably easier for me","I feel fantastic rn, (it probably helps that I don't have contamination OCD because... Gah my heart goes out to y'all) and it's honestly mostly because of my OCD. I always hate to see ""What good impacts has OCD had on your life?"" stuff bc I hate giving such a crippling disorder credit for anything, but in the current situation I can't deny that having it has had a hugely positive impact on my wellbeing.

Over the past week I've watched basically the entire world live like I've lived the past four years of my life. Crippling fear of face-to-face socialization and making plans, as well as being disabled and out of work, has made me basically live in self isolation for a very long time... So I'm incredibly well adapted to the circumstance. I don't feel trapped anymore, and I know how to use digital spaces and what's available to me to fill my time and not feel alone. Honestly, with everyone being trapped and spending a bunch of time online looking for connections to fill their time I feel the least alone I have in a very long time.

Also, I feel like I'm way better adapted to assessing how worried I should actually be about what's going wrong, and way more in control of how it affects me because I've had to arduously train myself to be realistic about the things that worry me in extreme ways while still taking any reasonable precautions that are necessary. The skills I've developed for coping with my OCD translate super well to coping with a terrifying crisis, I guess.

Everything is strange and backwards. The world is burning... And I guess I feel like I'm in control and know how to handle it.",OCD,1584597413,Irreleverent,1,1,True,2020-03-19
Feels like the pandemic was my fault because too many good things were happening to me,"I know it‚Äôs not true but it‚Äôs such an obsessive thought, I feel like now if bad things happen it‚Äôll get better faster and that god or karma is punishing me (I‚Äôm not religious) for being too happy. 

I was so good about fixing a lot of my rituals like my eating habits but this is getting back out of control. I‚Äôm starving because I can‚Äôt eat anything outside of groups of threes and I‚Äôm scared to eat enough to feel full because I‚Äôm scared if I do it‚Äôll count as a ‚Äúgood‚Äù thing and something bad will happen to counteract it. 

I‚Äôm miserable. 

Does anyone have any good advice for escaping the eating compulsion? Usually I can get around it by eating with or around other people but I‚Äôve been isolated for almost a week and it‚Äôs getting to me.",OCD,1584598866,myftmtransaccount,7,1,True,2020-03-19
OCD and Music,"I was just curious as to whether anyone can listen to a single song for weeks on end? I know most people will play a song on 'repeat' a few times, maybe even for a few hours, but is it an OCD trait to play a single  song for weeks at a time? This doesn't happen all the time. However, sometimes I'll hear a song or one will come to mind, and I'll literally listen to it almost exclusively for about 2-3 weeks (then get bored with it and not listen to it for a while). This doesn't bother me, and the repetition isn't to reduce anxiety; it's enjoyable, actually.

Obsession is ruining my life and I really need help,"I am in university, but I started university very early, so I am still a teenager. I am gradually losing all of the intelligence, all the talents, and all the ambition I had. I am staying up until 3 every day and avoiding leaving my chair. I am completely obsessed with the pop singer Bj√∂rk and I spend every free second I have watching interviews and reading about her or listening to her music.

I have always been a little too interested in music. I have been immersed for the last two years completely into 90s indie rock and screamo. I make music of my own by myself, and I try to record everything as if it was the 90s, using 4-track and shitty amps and such. But this turned from a hobby to an obsession quickly. I spent too much time everyday looking for new even more obscure bands and searching for demo tapes and obscure 7 inch records. I read all about the musicians and I know a ridiculous amount about the Canadian screamo scene of the early 90s. I imagine myself as part of these shows. I dissociate into the old footage. I imagine talking to the people in the bands. I lost all interest in my studies and in daily life. I live completely in my own head, trapped in the stories of local scenes and basement shows, and unable to go back to my real life.

The sort of isolation I experience from being separated from my peer group and my obsession with 90s music created a perfect storm for me to be completely obsessed with Bj√∂rk. I can't stand going too long without listening to her music or watching interviews with her or at least reading about her. It's like a fucking drug. I stay up all night. I waste the entire day. I draw pictures of her. I re-play videos of her smiling or laughing over and over until I start crying. I am a disgusting piece of shit and I'll never amount to anything because I spend too damn long in a time I don't live in, imagining that I am friends with a girl who no longer exists.

I am trapped and every minute I waste is a minute I get closer to death. A minute I will never get back. A minute someone else could have used better than me.",OCD,1584608344,ohnopleasehavemercy,0,1,True,2020-03-19
Reassuring thoughts. How do you think and function without them?,"Tough to sum up, but in general I'm having trouble with the reassuring thoughts thing. I've been in CBT for a while, still working on it, but I'll keep it general. How far and how literally do you take the idea of not thinking reassuring thoughts?

For me while working on reducing the frequency and need of them works, it's tough to see an endgame where I don't have any. Since just thinking about things, seeing things, reading etc, it's tough not to judge. And if you judge a thing to be worrying or negative, for me I feel a need to think something reassuring.

One example is when I read something worrying, like somebody feels bad or had a tragedy. I'll think ""sorry to hear that"", or something like that. During exposure, the idea is to just not think that. But in the end what does that mean, does it mean when I see bad things I just don't stop to think about it? And if I do, I don't stop to try and put something to make myself feel better like thinking about how I care and am concerned etc. I feel like if I really did that, it'd be very much stoicism / zen, which is cool and all, but is tough to imagine being attainable for me. 

And that example aside, also the general just trying to cheer yourself up type of reassuring. Positive self talk as they call it. To me that's a big part of my thought process, if I think something through I cap it off with something positive. But I'm not supposed to is the thing, since I do it so much. And I've reduced it a bit, practicing delaying and windows where I aim not to etc.

I'm just not sure what thinking and the experience of taking in things really is if you are completely checked out and not judging. It sounds relaxing if it;s possible, but I can't quite picture it, and it's tough to go for a goal when you don't really understand the goal completely clearly. And I do still ask about this sort of stuff at CBT, which is going well, but my therapist doesn't want to give me persmission that I can reassure ""some"" naturally. So I wonder how far that goes, how I can think about things without this being part of my thoughts in the future, and as you can tell I can really go on trying to understand and analyze this, and it hasn't fully been resolved there.

I do agree on reducing, I just don't know how to think about things without any reassuring being involved. How can you think things through or take in new information without judging it, and at times trying to reassure that it is ok, or put a positive spin on it?

I know this is a bit of a ramble, so a brief version: If you're trying to not have any reassuring thoughts, how far do you take that? And how do you go about life and thinking in general without that being part of it?",OCD,1584610603,NuttyMetallic,0,1,True,2020-03-19

Can someone help give me solutions for dealing with cat hair?,"I've been very unhappy in my home because theres a ton of cat fur everywhere. My roommate has two cats (fyi I wasnt consulted about the cats before she moved in, it's just been something I had to learn to accept) 
and they're cute cats but they get fur EVERYWHERE.

I've lived with cats my whole life but they were always indoor/outdoor cats so there wasnt too much fur at the house, but these cats are indoor.

For the longest time I was sweeping like 8 times a day, and there would always just be more fur. My entire meal would be ruined if I saw a cat fur floating in the air. 

I've finally purchased a vacuum, but even then as I vacuum, a few minutes later theres just more fur. 



So now, my roommates on vacation for a week and took her cats to her moms house to watch them. Being home a lone I've deep cleaned the house, finally 4 days in, I've managed to get rid of almost all the residual fur and it feels like such a fresh breath of air. 

I'm really concerned for when my roommate and her cats come back, especially now that we are in forced quarantine for COVID, I'm gonna lose my fucking mind if I have to see cat fur all day. 

Pleaseee what do I do? I cant spend my whole day cleaning, I also want to talk to her about how she can help clean.

I live in a county where there is little to no treatment for EOCD (Existential OCD). I just read that, for most kinds of OCD, it's helpful to be exposed to these existential questions and to remind myself that it's okay to not know the answer. It's suppossed to make me feel comfortable with uncertainty. 
But except for that (and medication), it seems like there's nothing else I can do. 
What do you guys do? It would be amazing if there's anyone who knows a bit more about this. So thank you in advance! :)",OCD,1584624858,couragestorm,4,1,True,2020-03-19

"Just found this sub, I‚Äôm not sure what to do or where to go","I want to start out by saying I haven‚Äôt been diagnosed with OCD or anything. I‚Äôve never been to a psychiatrist and the therapists I‚Äôve had don‚Äôt give you diagnosis.

I‚Äôm going to try and keep this short. As long as I can remember I‚Äôve had compulsive behaviours and intrusive thoughts. It was never constant and my obsessions always changed, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve had one sticking around. For a while, I‚Äôd go to bed and get up several times before falling asleep to turn the light on and check my whole bedroom for bugs. That went away and I don‚Äôt even remember how or when. Then I got scared of having a STD, got tested and was convinced I had HIV. I cried to my dad saying I had HIV. I laugh at this now because, well, I told my dad I had the worst STD when I was only 18 and didn‚Äôt even have the results yet. When I got the results it was obvious I didn‚Äôt have any STDs, but I went to 3 different doctors in different walk in clinics for them to look at my results and tell me I didn‚Äôt have anything. That was all in the same day, and that same night I couldn‚Äôt sleep and went to the ER to get another doctor to tell me I didn‚Äôt have a STD. 
Fast forward and I‚Äôm working full time, going to the washroom every 15 min to check my whole body for these red dots - which most people have and they‚Äôre normal. But I was convinced I had something serious. That also went away and I also don‚Äôt remember when or how.

I had a break from all of that when I started smoking weed 4 years ago. I quit smoking 50 days ago and since then it‚Äôs been hell. I had my first ever panic attack 4 days into sobriety, and because my heart went up to 160bpm I couldn‚Äôt stop checking my pulse several times a day, every day for weeks following that attack. 

I‚Äôve lost quite a bit of weight due to withdrawals and extreme anxiety, and because of that I started tracking my food intake to make sure I was eating enough. I don‚Äôt want to lose weight anymore, I‚Äôm scared of it. Keep in mind I was overweight to begin with (25F 5‚Äô5‚Äù 175 lbs - I‚Äôm 155 lbs as of today). So I‚Äôve been weighing my food with a kitchen scale and logging it into this calorie count app, and got obsessed over vitamins and sodium intake. First I got obsessed I was eating too much vitamin A. Then a few days ago I thought I drank too much water (even though it was the same amount, that I drink every day - around 3 litres a day) and barely had any water the following days, and whenever I took a sip I‚Äôd feel nauseous. I‚Äôm still afraid of drinking water. I should also mention that as soon as I had my first panic attack I stopped eating anything that could spike my blood sugar, because I was convinced that it‚Äôd send me into another panic attack. 

Even though I failed at keeping this short I hope someone reads it. Did anyone have a similar experience? What‚Äôs your opinion? I‚Äôd like to know what I can do to help myself. I already go to therapy but I‚Äôm a researcher and I like finding ways I can help myself outside of therapy. I just want to be able to eat enough and drink water, I can‚Äôt afford getting sick during this pandemic and don‚Äôt want to have to go to a doctor now that they‚Äôre with their hands full.",OCD,1584627795,cocosp,1,1,True,2020-03-19
R-OCD triggered by real events [trigger warning],"Hi, I am a bit stuck in my situation and don't know what to do. A few weeks ago, I confessed to my girlfriend that I had been unfaithful to her online, as I decided that our relationship needed absolute truthfulness and I was unjustifiable in hiding it from her. However, since then, confessing things has become a compulsion. Any time I see anything slightly sexually arousing, I feel I need to tell her. Any time I remember some new detail of my acting out, I have to tell her. I worry that she has forgotten things I have already confessed to her, and I need to tell her again. The questions that she asks and her lack of trust in me lead me to developing false memories, and delving further and further into questioning myself. I feel like the nature of ocd makes it really difficult to reassure her of these things, because it makes me question them myself. She wants these confessions to stop, but at the same time doesn't want me to be hiding anything (which is totally reasonable), which I think makes it very very difficult to overcome this obsession as it is constantly being triggered. This definitely makes it difficult for the obsession to go quickly (the best analogy I can think of is trying to get rid of contamination OCD when you're constantly reading the news about different pathogens). We have discussed breaking up, but I do not want to lose this relationship.

How to distinguish between OCD and legitimate fear?,"I guess I just really needed to reach out and talk to some people today 

I‚Äôve suffered from and recovered from my morality OCD/scrupulosity OCD/ secular scrupulosity OCD/ and now it‚Äôs combined with my Health OCD

I have had a lot of health anxiety that will randomly pop up in my life.

With long bouts of recovery so I know I can get better but it seems my ocd thinking has snuck back into my thoughts 

But my anxiety has been:

Afraid of being pregnant even though I never had sex.

Afraid of having tetanus even though my shots were up to date.

Afraid of having rabies.

So I know my ocd thinking has latched on to health before.

So now:

So I got into researching mental health to help me with my ocd.  Got my hands on a DSM5 and ohhhh boy.

My brain has been racing about every horrifying mental illness you could imagine.

The scariest and worst ones are the ones my OCD latched on to and it feels worse than ever because there‚Äôs no way you can truly check if you don‚Äôt or do have some of these things.  No brain scan for some of these things.  Idk I keep checking the symptoms to prove to myself that I don‚Äôt have these illnesses.  I watch interviews of famous criminals with these horrifying diagnosis in the hopes to prove to myself I‚Äôm not like them.

I‚Äôm doing an OCD workbook right now and working on stopping my reassurance seeking.  It‚Äôs helping kinda but I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll be obsessing about this for the rest of my life.

At least with cancer/viruses/tetanus it‚Äôs your body that‚Äôs sick, it‚Äôs not your fault.  

If you‚Äôre a sociopath/psychopath or have a personality disorder you‚Äôre inherently sick.  Your personality is contaminated.  You have an illness that causes other people pain.  I literally can‚Äôt imagine a worse thing.

The thought of having a mental health disorder that makes me evil is giving me a panic attack.

My heart is racing and I can‚Äôt sleep because of the intense fear.

(possible TW) OCD causes me to shut down when it gets to be overwhelming; A Novel.,"This is long and I apologise in advance for it. There are possible trigger warnings in here for those who are in a bad mental state, get really uneasy with disorganization, or are in a bad place in regards to COVID-19. Please read with caution. 

Lately, I feel like my OCD is getting worse and worse. Sometimes, I convince myself that it's more than OCD and I'm full blown mentally cracked. (Having been in therapy when I was younger for Psychosis, I'm sure that plays a role into all of this too). 

Mainly, what's really got my goat, to say, was yesterday when my boss slammed me with piles of work regarding the COVID-19 pandemic (I work in Healthcare). But it wasn't so much the amount that got me.
They sat at my desk. Wrote in my notebook. Knocked over my desk decorations.

Sure, all things I can fix. 
I clean my desk every morning. I have a ritual. I have to clean, touch the little lucky cat I have, turn on the light, sit down, light candle, then get the computer going. If I don't do this in this order, it throws off my whole day. It's dumb and I know it but it's just what I need to do. 
I have everything carefully placed. It has to be that way. Or it will bother me. 
Seeing it all get pushed around and such, and having them throw so much at me, along with their explanation of HOW to do it (which, in addition, caused me to have to redo about a week's worth of work) just didn't sit well.
 It was messy, and it was not well planned or laid out. 

If I have to do something, it needs to be neat. If it's messy, it'll never be finished. I even had to rip out the page they wrote and rewrite it myself. It needed to be my handwriting. They left me with this mess and honestly, I completely shut down. 

I haven't shut down like that in a long time. I drew a complete blank and it took me close to two hours to recover from it and start to produce something to present to her. Luckily, they were happy with it. It is clean and clear to them, though they were a little overwhelmed by how much was on it. 
I didn't know what else to do, so I put everything. 

As I said, this was yesterday. 
Today, I'm still cleaning up this mess. I did my morning ritual, but because this is a mess, I can almost still FEEL the mess. 

I'm not sure if this makes sense, it's just me rambling on at this point, venting to people who would understand. 
I feel like I've completely overreacted, but it's all internal and I don't think they noticed, besides for my awkward quietness that kinda fell on me after they gave it all to me.

Immediately I felt guilty and wiped the lid off with a wipe. I feel absolutely awful and dont know what would possess me to do something like that. I guess I genuinely believed my family would be all right. But I still feel awful about it.

Feel like CBT and other methods don‚Äôt do anything to take away the anxiety,"I‚Äôm process of getting therapy appointment setup. Trying to go back on meds for anxiety. Never thought about ocd until now so going to consider meds and treatment for that. 

Anxiety so bad I‚Äôm confessing every bad thing I‚Äôve ever done telling my wife. (Not terrible things no cheating, but still extremely hard to admit or discuss)

Concerned that is just reassurance seeking because anxiety comes back  and keeps latching onto something else. 

I think the point of ocd management is focusing on now and not fighting the intrusive thoughts. 

Aside from taking some Xanax in the meantime, I‚Äôm trying not to take too much of that. Trying CBT again but that isn‚Äôt working.

"Normally don't post because no one replies, but desperate for help","I've been struggling from a debilitating, and I mean torturous form of OCD for two years now. For months I had a grip on it, though it was still very intrusive and debilitating. But the last three months have been brutal. I have no control over my mind or my actions. I try to stop, sometimes I get lucky, but the need to do a compulsion is overwhelming and not doing it messes with my head. The compulsions and obsessions center on breathing (sensorimotor OCD) and intrusive thoughts. No matter what I do, I always feel as if I made a mistake. Maybe I read something wrong, I didn't click something right. I have to then re-read or click in number patterns of 3, 4, and 8. If it's not done right, I have to re-do it correctly. Then my brain tells me I have to breathe, as if I may not be breathing right while doing these things. So I have to compulsively, and forcefully breathe in number patterns along with the patterns I'm already doing. The breathing can be overwhelming to the point that my muscles and back hurts, the taste in my mouth is thrown off, and weakness fills my body.

When I decide not to do a compulsion, my mind plays tricks on me and tells me everything feels off. That nothing will be normal unless I do the compulsions. On top of all of this, while I'm doing the compulsions (checking and counting while breathing compulsively) intrusive thoughts pop into my head, usually of a weird or disgusting nature, and force me to do a new set of compulsions. These new compulsions involve the intrusive thought and I have to neutralize it with a better thought in a number pattern. Then I have to go back to the previous patterns and compulsively finish them off.

The breathing is the most debilitating aspect. It's the worst thing you can imagine. I'm sick of it, and I just want to break free from this self-destructive illness.

Glass objects OCD [WARNING: MAY BE TRIGGERING],"Hi guys,

Please don't read this if you are very susceptible to triggering ideas. Don't want people here to gain new obsessions &amp; compulsions because of my post.

I was wondering if there are more people here having obsessions and compulsions related to glass objects. Whenever I¬¥m, for example, doing the dishes and handling glass objects (e.g. wine glasses), I always get this fear that I unnoticeably damage the glass object, and leave small glass shards into the object. This leads me further ruminating that in the future a family member could drink out of this same glass and ingest the mini glass shards, then internally injuring him/herself (possibly dying). Sometimes, these horrible thoughts make me want to engage in compulsions, such as obsessively making sure that there are no shards in the glass objects. Sometimes, however, I consciously choose NOT to engage in any of these compulsions (which is an ERP method), but this leads me to hours or days being anxious of the idea that I'm potentially injuring or killing a family member. I've tried these ERP methods (not engaging in compulsions) for multiple times, but the anxiety doesn't necessarily become less each time, which makes it hard to maintain faith in this ERP strategy. 

Are there more people here having this same kind of obsession? And if yes, how do you deal with it? I've had success with ERP on elimaniting certain compulsions (e.g. obsessive hand washing), but it does not seem too successful on eliminating this specific one. Am I possibly not trying hard enough with ERP?

Bad COCD guilt,"I've been worried that I have the coronavirus without symptoms (even though no one in my county (not country) has it.)

Immediately I felt guilty and I wiped down the lid with a wipe. I still feel absolutely awful. Deep down I'm sure i dont have the virus but I feel guilty. I'm worried my family could get sick and then get other people sick and it'd be all my fault.

*Introduction:* ever since I accepted the uncertainty of my sexuality (2-3 years ago), I've let myself have crushes on girls and I also started having sexual/romantic fantasies with fictional people/characters that were female (of course, I also had with male characters but less). Before this, I only had fantasies with boys but I finally felt ""free"" after 10 years of suffering with my sexual orientation. 

**SEXUAL FANTASIES:**

Now, false memories appear. (since when my pocd started) I don't think I have ever had fantasies (romantic or sexual) with children or even young teens (like 13-15). But I am afraid I did and I don't remember and that *my fantasies indicate that I have ""p"" tendencies.* - this is the main topic of this post. I also fear that I may involved r-pe in these fantasies but I believe I have never imagined this, on purpose or unconsciously (I've reviewed every single one of them - the ones I remember) but that is why I'm making this post... To get an opinion. 

At the time that I had these fantasies, I was trying to ""explore"" my sexuality and I thought I wasn't doing anything wrong - I truly didn't!! Or I wouldn't have done it!... But now, I regret doing this for such a long time only realizing it was WRONG and shameful what I did only a few months before my OCD exploded. 

3 of all fictional characters I had crushes/fantasies were around 16-17 in the game. (Well, 2 of them weren't actually 17 (it was revealed later in the series that they were older - around 19). And the other character, I really thought she was older (like 22 - she looked mature) because there is no age reference in the game but a few months ago I searched for her age and lots of people told that she was probably in her late teenage years (16-17). 

However, I must confess that I had a small crush on my original character (she was 14-16) but I never had sexual fantasies with her. (this will later be explained) 

My masturbat- fantasies were a bit odd - Involved odd places (not exactly public places) and storylines and, in my opinion, they were a bit disgusting (perverted) in my opinion... But I don't know what ""normal"" is that's why I want to confess... 

I know that my ""wildest"" fantasies are things I would never do... Or never wanted to do (or at least I hope I didn't)! In my mind, they seemed interesting to ""try"" but in real life, nope. 

I'm not trying to shame anyone that has sexual fantasies. Part of me knows this is the result of my ""golden child syndrome"" (I am not diagnosing myself with this particular disease. But I easily feel guilty or ashamed for things I do wrong due to fear of disappointing others) and my anxiety/OCD. They trigger my sexual orientation OCD and POCD making me feel like a predator - I feel like *I* shouldn't like girls‚Ä¶ It's ""wrong"" and I'm objectifying them‚Ä¶ 

With one of the characters (I know this is wrong), I explored her hypersexuality in my fantasies. Everything was consensual but part of me now feels ashamed/icky about it. It is wrong! I didn't consider the consequences this would bring in real life. It involved a lot of her clingy personality. Why I liked her? I really thought she is a sweet person. In my fantasies, I would make feel happy... I guess, I saw in her what I see in myself: a weak person. And since I experienced a sort of connection with her, I also developed a crush on her, a big crush. Not to the point to take me out of the real world (I knew she wasn't real and as I'm writing this, I feel nothing but shame) but to make me feel less lonely. There were times (not always) where I wanted to be with someone and my imagination was something that helped me to fill that ""void"". Until I met my beautiful girlfriend (she's the love of my life), I was not in the best time of my life... I'm not dating her for the sake of being in a relationship because I have never dated before and I've had a few opportunities... I'm rambling... I guess that, I craved intimacy but I never sought or wanted that with someone where I didn't have a bond with. (and I'm still a virgin) 

Moving on to fictional people: Fictional people were created randomly to satisfy sometimes my romantic fantasies but mostly my masturb- sessions. 

I don't know how to explain this without sounding disgusting... I am so afraid that these ""thoughts"" expressed predatory or even r-pe behavior (I sometimes panic and cut myself over this).

I really don't know how... Hum- ""Intimacy"" (I mean intercourse) works between girls... I have heard a few things but I really don't know so I kinda imagined it with some logic and the few information I had... 

Most of my first (masturb-) fantasies, I took a more passive role... If you know what I mean (I apologise for not being too explicit) - these involved mature men and women with strong leading personalities. But after a while, I started imagining myself in a more ""active"" role (giving, instead of receiving, if that makes sense), being more confident... Thinking back, I believe the point of this was because I was so scared to be the active one (if that ever happened) so I started practicing to be more ""active"" in my mind, the one who ""takes control of the situation"" (being the ""top"", in lack of a better word) - which led me to have fantasies where I was the one to lure the other person, to make her feel confortable, to led her to engage in intimacy with me. This all feels manipulation to me now (or sexual pressure). I would never force anyone to have s-x with me. But these fantasies of me being confident and ""smooth with the ladies"" (not a cheater of course... Just being more the confident in the relationship) make me feel predatory and even led me to think about r-pe. And it's not all... But me being more ""masculine"" (I apologise for employing this awful term) in these fantasies, I often thought of the other woman being shorter than me, more feminine, more cute, sweeter, acute voice, round/soft physical features, more young looking (which are traits I associate with children). At the time, that triggered my POCD but I (tried to) dismiss those thoughts. I wish I hadn't, now I regret them entirely‚Ä¶ in conclusion, whenever I was the ""top"" in those past fantasies (I'm so sorry if this is the wrong term), the other women were more ""child-like"". 

In this paragraph, I will reveal a particular fantasy I had: In this one, I'm taking an active role in this one (the one ""touching"") - so I lure her and make her confortable enough to let me undress her and touch her intimately. My problem is because she is the ""bottom"" (again, apologies for the awful terminology), I imagined her to be a sweet, shy lady, more short than me... (I'm average-tall) so I'm afraid this was a child instead of a woman because I didn't imagine her body (I don't have a body type or a detailed face - everything was fairly blirrer) but since she had child like features (both personality, height, structure - she almost seemed to be the stereotypical sweet anime girl), I'm so afraid that I actually fantasized with a child. I must add that I was already struggling with pocd in this episode (and many other) and the entire time I was like ""this is fine. She's the same age as me. I'm not doing anything wrong."" I wished I hadn't fight it - I wished I had simply avoid having these fantasies instead.

*I can't shake the feeling that I did something wrong!! That I fantasized with a child‚Ä¶ I'm terrified‚Ä¶*

I'm a very passive person (in terms of personality)... I would never flirt or be ""smooth with the ladies"" nor I want to! (I just want to flirt with my girlfriend) Honestly, I always felt uncomfortable when someone liked me or even when someone else was more ""flirty"" with me... Just‚Ä¶ No.  My fantasies never involved anything dangerous  (they were simple and nothing too weird, just a little bit, I think). But I'm really scared they might mean something bad.

I know that fantasies or thoughts don't represent what we want. But I feel so bad... And scared. I have been thinking that, I'm a odd person who developed sexuality in a weird way. Until I had 16-17, I was asexual with zero interest in s-x but by that age, my interest on the topic increased and I began to have sexual fantasies [I started masturb- when I turned 20 (which happened by accident)]. Even my therapist found this odd. I was also mentally sexually abused by a family member (not physically). So I'm afraid that my weird development somehow contributed for me to be a ""p"". 

My fears? 
- I'm afraid I subconsciously fantasized with children or that something above means I'm a ""p"". I don't exactly have a body/face preference or a type however, by imagining ""sweet-like"" features, this means that I have a ""p"" tendencies... I guess I fell into the stereotypical ""bottom"" girl that I see on tv/anime. 
- to accept the uncertainty of being a ""p"" and engage in fantasies that are immoral and harmful to children, like I did with my sexual orientation. 

It's worth to add that I feel like a predator when I find girls pretty... I never did anything to anyone but it makes me feel gross that I found girls attractive... It felt like I was objectifying them. And this feeling started a bit before this major depressive episode started...

It has gotten so bad that I feel absolutely disgusting and I'm slowly returning to my asexual old self. To my shame (my shame only, I'm not judging others), I craved touch and affection which now makes me feel perverted. Now, I just want a strong romantic bond with my girlfriend. I wouldn't be able to do anything more to the fear of feeling like a rapist.

I still haven't discussed this topic deeply with my therapist (although she knows a major portion of it). I'm afraid she'll minimize the situation. ""it's all in your head"" she'll say. I feel like she is tired of me and my problems. She doesn't believe I'm a ""p"" but I have big problems in my head. 

- - - √ó - - -

**ROMANTIC FANTASIES:**

The romantic fantasies are pathetic at some extent, cringy like most people would say if they knew. Like I said, I was alone most of the time... And the crushes on fictional characters filled this void that existed.

Before dating, I used to fantasize with flirting... But not as an adult, but as teenager... To make myself clear, I used to fantasize a lot being back in high school [ you can ask me why - I don't know. I hated high school. My opinion is that I dislike being an adult so I wished I could come back where things were simpler but not to a state of childhood... Or maybe I feel like I haven't mature since I was 17. I'm in my young 20s now but it hasn't gone well...)

I'm afraid this alone represents that I am attracted to teenagers... Despite knowing deep down that this isn't true... I may feel 16/17 inside and I look 15 (it's stupid, but I do...) but my real attractions correspond to people my age. (at least I hope so, OCD is my enemy)

I have always been a weakling... A shy girl... And in my past fantasies, I dreamed about being bold. I still have a lot of internalized homophobia and this brings a lot of guilt when fantasizing with girls...

The romantic ones are very mild... Nothing crazy flirting... But it bothers me that I have fantasized being 17 flirting with 15-17 fictional people when I was in my early 20s (does it make sense?). at the time, I didn't think I was doing anything wrong. I was at the same age rank but after my ocd exploded, guilt fell over these thoughts.

The one that bothers me the most is with one character I created where she was 15-16... Because last night I began to panic over... ""what if she was younger? (like 13 or below) maturity and aged body don't exactly mean older"" ; ""what if I had sexual fantasies with her too? (I don't remember any but my brain is already creating false memories)""; ""Is she younger?"" and the fantasies involved us flirting with each other (like we had soft crushes on each other, nothing major - though one fantasy involved a quick kiss).

There was another one ""half-fantasy"" (the other person had no face where I was the strong one and the other girl was the weak one... It irks me... Because I'm the weak one.... I'm the shy one‚Ä¶ (I hate what anime culture did to me. It disrupted my thoughts and I never watched much of it!) 

Well, that's it... I feel awful... I feel so bad... I feel so cringy for fantasizing with fictional characters... Like... *I'm so gross-*

**MORAL OCD:**

I feel like I ought to kill myself‚Ä¶ I have engaged in self harm in the past due to this topic. 
I haven't done it in a while‚Ä¶ Hurt myself, I mean. I need to punish myself! 

Do I deserve to live?? No‚Ä¶ 

Do I deserve to be happy?? No. 

I'm so sorry to my loved ones‚Ä¶ I am nothing but a disappointment. I'm disgusting and shameful. I wished I was never born‚Ä¶ I was a mistake, you know? My mom the other day was telling me how she should had never got married and she's right. I wasn't supposed to be born‚Ä¶ It would be for the best. My girlfriend deserves someone better anyway. I should just ""grow a pair"" and end my life. I'm so sorry to my darling‚Ä¶ You deserve better‚Ä¶ I'm sorry to be such a disappointment to you. 

I hope I didn't forget any important detail‚Ä¶ At least, I don't think so. People tell me I'm a good person but I'm not‚Ä¶ I keep remembering these fantasies and it doesn't hit right. I feel like, if they knew 100% of the details, they would call me a ""p"". More than fear of being one, I'm so afraid I already engaged in that behavior‚Ä¶ Like these fantasies and that I should commit suicide because I couldn't forgive myself if these are really wrong (moral-wise)

I guess what I am wondering is if anyone here has a similar story or knows of someone who has. Or has any words of advice..anything really.

I‚Äôm in my mid-thirties and have struggled with ocd since I was a child. Unfortunately I had a lot of avoidant compulsive behaviours and I felt deeply ashamed and disgusted by myself. On top of that I was being bullied at school, which to me confirmed my opinion of myself. So I never told anyone, about my thoughts or the bullying.

I was ‚Äúthe perfect child‚Äù and somehow I got stuck in this role of the perfect perfectionist, that always looked and presented herself immaculately, while inside I was dying. My compulsions have always been mostly mental, such as counting, checking, repeating and ruminating, so they were easier to hide. And so the years went by in a haze. I don‚Äôt recall ever being really happy or not worried. Just year after year of surviving, not living.

This past year my ocd has been steadily spiralling and has now reached a level that I haven‚Äôt experienced before. It‚Äôs scary and I feel like I am about to lose all control. I have lost a lot of weight and regularly stay up for 40+ hours at a time, stuck in a loop of obsessions and compulsions.

But now, I regret doing this for such a long time only realizing it was WRONG and shameful what I did only a few months before my OCD exploded. 

3 of all fictional characters I had crushes/fantasies were around 16-17 in the game. (Well, 2 of them weren't actually 17 (it was revealed later in the series that they were older - around 19). And the other character, I really thought she was older (like 22 - she looked mature) because there is no age reference in the game but a few months ago I searched for her age and lots of people told that she was probably in her late teenage years (16-17). 

However, I must confess that I had a small crush on my original character (she was 14-16) but I never had sexual fantasies with her. (this will later be explained) 

My masturbat- fantasies were a bit odd - Involved odd places (not exactly public places) and storylines and, in my opinion, they were a bit disgusting (perverted) in my opinion... But I don't know what ""normal"" is that's why I want to confess... 

I know that my ""wildest"" fantasies are things I would never do... Or never wanted to do (or at least I hope I didn't)! In my mind, they seemed interesting to ""try"" but in real life, nope. 

I'm not trying to shame anyone that has sexual fantasies. Part of me knows this is the result of my ""golden child syndrome"" (I am not diagnosing myself with this particular disease. But I easily feel guilty or ashamed for things I do wrong due to fear of disappointing others) and my anxiety/OCD. They trigger my sexual orientation OCD and POCD making me feel like a predator - I feel like *I* shouldn't like girls‚Ä¶ It's ""wrong"" and I'm objectifying them‚Ä¶ 

With one of the characters (I know this is wrong), I explored her hypersexuality in my fantasies. Everything was consensual but part of me now feels ashamed/icky about it. It is wrong! I didn't consider the consequences this would bring in real life. It involved a lot of her clingy personality. Why I liked her? I really thought she is a sweet person. In my fantasies, I would make feel happy... I guess, I saw in her what I see in myself: a weak person. And since I experienced a sort of connection with her, I also developed a crush on her, a big crush. Not to the point to take me out of the real world (I knew she wasn't real and as I'm writing this, I feel nothing but shame) but to make me feel less lonely. There were times (not always) where I wanted to be with someone and my imagination was something that helped me to fill that ""void"". Until I met my beautiful girlfriend (she's the love of my life), I was not in the best time of my life... I'm not dating her for the sake of being in a relationship because I have never dated before and I've had a few opportunities... I'm rambling... I guess that, I craved intimacy but I never sought or wanted that with someone where I didn't have a bond with. (and I'm still a virgin) 

Moving on to fictional people: Fictional people were created randomly to satisfy sometimes my romantic fantasies but mostly my masturb- sessions. 

I don't know how to explain this without sounding disgusting... I am so afraid that these ""thoughts"" expressed predatory or even r-pe behavior (I sometimes panic and cut myself over this).

I really don't know how... Hum- ""Intimacy"" (I mean intercourse) works between girls... I have heard a few things but I really don't know so I kinda imagined it with some logic and the few information I had... 

Most of my first (masturb-) fantasies, I took a more passive role... If you know what I mean (I apologise for not being too explicit) - these involved mature men and women with strong leading personalities. But after a while, I started imagining myself in a more ""active"" role (giving, instead of receiving, if that makes sense), being more confident... Thinking back, I believe the point of this was because I was so scared to be the active one (if that ever happened) so I started practicing to be more ""active"" in my mind, the one who ""takes control of the situation"" (being the ""top"", in lack of a better word) - which led me to have fantasies where I was the one to lure the other person, to make her feel confortable, to led her to engage in intimacy with me. This all feels manipulation to me now (or sexual pressure). I would never force anyone to have s-x with me. But these fantasies of me being confident and ""smooth with the ladies"" (not a cheater of course... Just being more the confident in the relationship) make me feel predatory and even led me to think about r-pe. And it's not all... But me being more ""masculine"" (I apologise for employing this awful term) in these fantasies, I often thought of the other woman being shorter than me, more feminine, more cute, sweeter, acute voice, round/soft physical features, more young looking (which are traits I associate with children). At the time, that triggered my POCD but I (tried to) dismiss those thoughts. I wish I hadn't, now I regret them entirely‚Ä¶ in conclusion, whenever I was the ""top"" in those past fantasies (I'm so sorry if this is the wrong term), the other women were more ""child-like"". 

In this paragraph, I will reveal a particular fantasy I had: In this one, I'm taking an active role in this one (the one ""touching"") - so I lure her and make her confortable enough to let me undress her and touch her intimately. My problem is because she is the ""bottom"" (again, apologies for the awful terminology), I imagined her to be a sweet, shy lady, more short than me... (I'm average-tall) so I'm afraid this was a child instead of a woman because I didn't imagine her body (I don't have a body type or a detailed face - everything was fairly blirrer) but since she had child like features (both personality, height, structure - she almost seemed to be the stereotypical sweet anime girl), I'm so afraid that I actually fantasized with a child. I must add that I was already struggling with pocd in this episode (and many other) and the entire time I was like ""this is fine. She's the same age as me. I'm not doing anything wrong."" I wished I hadn't fight it - I wished I had simply avoid having these fantasies instead.

*I can't shake the feeling that I did something wrong!! That I fantasized with a child‚Ä¶ I'm terrified‚Ä¶*

I'm a very passive person (in terms of personality)... I would never flirt or be ""smooth with the ladies"" nor I want to! (I just want to flirt with my girlfriend) Honestly, I always felt uncomfortable when someone liked me or even when someone else was more ""flirty"" with me... Just‚Ä¶ No.  My fantasies never involved anything dangerous  (they were simple and nothing too weird, just a little bit, I think). But I'm really scared they might mean something bad.

I know that fantasies or thoughts don't represent what we want. But I feel so bad... And scared. I have been thinking that, I'm a odd person who developed sexuality in a weird way. Until I had 16-17, I was asexual with zero interest in s-x but by that age, my interest on the topic increased and I began to have sexual fantasies [I started masturb- when I turned 20 (which happened by accident)]. Even my therapist found this odd. I was also mentally sexually abused by a family member (not physically). So I'm afraid that my weird development somehow contributed for me to be a ""p"". 

At it baffles me that I used to fantasize with strong, confident women and then move over to shy, cute woman... What happened? Did my tastes changed? Or was I merely trying something new? Did I become a ""p""? 

My fears? 
- I'm afraid I subconsciously fantasized with children or that something above means I'm a ""p"". I don't exactly have a body/face preference or a type however, by imagining ""sweet-like"" features, this means that I have a ""p"" tendencies... I guess I fell into the stereotypical ""bottom"" girl that I see on tv/anime. 
- to accept the uncertainty of being a ""p"" and engage in fantasies that are immoral and harmful to children, like I did with my sexual orientation. 

It's worth to add that I feel like a predator when I find girls pretty... I never did anything to anyone but it makes me feel gross that I found girls attractive... It felt like I was objectifying them. And this feeling started a bit before this major depressive episode started...

It has gotten so bad that I feel absolutely disgusting and I'm slowly returning to my asexual old self. To my shame (my shame only, I'm not judging others), I craved touch and affection which now makes me feel perverted. Now, I just want a strong romantic bond with my girlfriend. I wouldn't be able to do anything more to the fear of feeling like a rapist.

I still haven't discussed this topic deeply with my therapist (although she knows a major portion of it). I'm afraid she'll minimize the situation. ""it's all in your head"" she'll say. I feel like she is tired of me and my problems. She doesn't believe I'm a ""p"" but I have big problems in my head.

**ROMANTIC FANTASIES:**

The romantic fantasies are pathetic at some extent, cringy like most people would say if they knew. Like I said, I was alone most of the time... And the crushes on fictional characters filled this void that existed.

Before dating, I used to fantasize with flirting... But not as an adult, but as teenager... To make myself clear, I used to fantasize a lot being back in high school [ you can ask me why - I don't know. I hated high school. My opinion is that I dislike being an adult so I wished I could come back where things were simpler but not to a state of childhood... Or maybe I feel like I haven't mature since I was 17. I'm in my young 20s now but it hasn't gone well...)

I'm afraid this alone represents that I am attracted to teenagers... Despite knowing deep down that this isn't true... I may feel 16/17 inside and I look 15 (it's stupid, but I do...) but my real attractions correspond to people my age. (at least I hope so, OCD is my enemy)

I have always been a weakling... A shy girl... And in my past fantasies, I dreamed about being bold. I still have a lot of internalized homophobia and this brings a lot of guilt when fantasizing with girls...

The romantic ones are very mild... Nothing crazy flirting... But it bothers me that I have fantasized being 17 flirting with 15-17 fictional people when I was in my early 20s (does it make sense?). at the time, I didn't think I was doing anything wrong. I was at the same age rank but after my ocd exploded, guilt fell over these thoughts.

The one that bothers me the most is with one character I created where she was 15-16... Because last night I began to panic over... ""what if she was younger? (like 13 or below) maturity and aged body don't exactly mean older"" ; ""what if I had sexual fantasies with her too? (I don't remember any but my brain is already creating false memories)""; ""Is she younger?"" and the fantasies involved us flirting with each other (like we had soft crushes on each other, nothing major - though one fantasy involved a quick kiss).

There was another one ""half-fantasy"" (the other person had no face where I was the strong one and the other girl was the weak one... It irks me... Because I'm the weak one.... I'm the shy one‚Ä¶ (I hate what anime culture did to me. It disrupted my thoughts and I never watched much of it!) 

Well, that's it... I feel awful... I feel so bad... I feel so cringy for fantasizing with fictional characters... Like... *I'm so gross-*

**MORAL OCD:**

I feel like I ought to kill myself‚Ä¶ I have engaged in self harm in the past due to this topic. 
I haven't done it in a while‚Ä¶ Hurt myself, I mean. I need to punish myself! 

Do I deserve to live?? No‚Ä¶ 

Do I deserve to be happy?? No. 

I'm so sorry to my loved ones‚Ä¶ I am nothing but a disappointment. I'm disgusting and shameful. I wished I was never born‚Ä¶ I was a mistake, you know? My mom the other day was telling me how she should had never got married and she's right. I wasn't supposed to be born‚Ä¶ It would be for the best. My girlfriend deserves someone better anyway. I should just ""grow a pair"" and end my life. I'm so sorry to my darling‚Ä¶ You deserve better‚Ä¶ I'm sorry to be such a disappointment to you. 

I hope I didn't forget any important detail‚Ä¶ At least, I don't think so. People tell me I'm a good person but I'm not‚Ä¶ I keep remembering these fantasies and it doesn't hit right. I feel like, if they knew 100% of the details, they would call me a ""p"". More than fear of being one, I'm so afraid I already engaged in that behavior‚Ä¶ Like these fantasies and that I should commit su-cide because I couldn't forgive myself if these are really wrong (moral-wise)

"Is this magical thinking OCD, around coronavirus?","For a while I was a little worried about that law of attraction stuff. I started getting OCD about not thinking bad or scary thoughts because I figured, if the law of attraction rubbish stated that I could attract good things by thinking about them, I didn't want to do the opposite. And my mind whirred over that a lot.

I also noticed things like when I would get a new car I would suddenly see that car around a lot, or if I saw a certain string of numbers, I would see that string around some more if I focused on it. I think I read that it was just a natural phenomenon where if you're looking for something specific, you brain has a good way to spot it out easily. Nothing special. But I think it did develop into a bit of an OCD obsession.

With this coronavirus stuff, because I'd read about pandemics or watched disaster shows or did anything to do with similar topics, my OCD has been flaring about the law of attraction stuff over this and I'm afraid of having thought about it and that been a contributor to it going on?

I‚Äôve had depression and anxiety(various kinds) diagnosed since I was 11-ish and there‚Äôs a lot of things I assumed were part of that, but now I‚Äôm second guessing. 
I know that I have OCD tendencies, I got that diagnosis towards the end of high school, but in the last few years I‚Äôve had intrusive self-destructive thoughts that I HATE. I assumed this was the depression but now I‚Äôm not sure? Especially since it comes at times I‚Äôm doing okay. And I‚Äôll get similar ‚Äòhey do this terrible thing‚Äô thoughts too but I kinda just wrote them off? 
Sorry I guess I‚Äôm basically wondering are these characteristic of depression and anxiety or more OCD?

Covid be bringing back my old handwashing compulsions &amp; I'm NOT here for it,"I have worked SO FUCKING HARD to reduce my handwashing in the past year or so, and I'm getting so frustrated with myself for giving into it more and more in recent weeks.

I'm back to aggressive scrubbing all the way up my forearms when I handwash, I'm thinking more &amp; more obsessively about how I'm ""contaminated"", and I'm already fucking exhausted from it :/

Its like, good god, OCD is one of the more annoying mental disorders to have right now, my depression hasn't been affected nearly as badly by corona.

I don't want to go back on antipsychotics for the OCD like I did when I was first treating this, they made me gain crazy weight and I felt so apathetic and slow all day. Like ya, I wasn't fucking obsessively thinking about how my hands were contaminated or whatever, but I legit just didn't give a fuck about anything on antipsychotics. 

I just wanted to rant a bit about this, I figure you guys can all relate to this feeling of being caught in a rock and a hard place with this virus.

 Like, being overly conscious about germs and washing hands more isn't necessarily a bad thing at this time???..I mean we arguably are positioned much better than most of the gen pop in terms of protecting ourselves &amp; others from this because we already are thinking so much about germs and contamination. But I'm to that tipping point where my heightened caution is no longer useful &amp; has begun to hinder my daily functioning again &amp; that's no bueno. 

I guess for whomever reads this far &amp; relates to this, any ideas on how to tow the line of handwashing in this dystopian hellscape we've found ourselves in? 

My knuckles are cracking and my top layer of skin is red and raw all up my forearms now from my handwashing. Doesn't help that I work in food service and I'm still working, so I HAVE to wash my hands a lot anyways. I'm fucking stressed y'all",OCD,1584702535,lcm97,1,1,True,2020-03-20

DAE's brains keep them awake with half-formed issues that they MUST solve?,"I'm very new to the OCD world after being in therapy for anxiety, depression, and (wrongly diagnosed/medicated and possibly confused with OCD) ADHD for years.

It was nothing but normal to me to think how I did,"I took a lot of the thinks I did as behaviors. Just specific to me and my twin who seemed to share the same quirks. And I thought OCD meant you were cleanly. I didn't like touching mops, dish rags, sponges, anything that had been used. Even though I was able to play like any child in the dirt. Dirt wasn't a problem. It was sharing drinks, using public bathrooms, touching doorknobs or stairwells, and having my stuff moved. I thought maybe I had Autism. But I had been tested young since I was a premature baby and my twin shared the same behavior. 

But my mind always raced. It wasn't just the story writing that I had picked up at twelve. It had become thoughts. One after another. Always thoughts that bothered me greatly. I couldn't stop. Weight was a huge one. I'm not going to say what I have done just in case anyone else suffered from an ED, but that was one. My dental tech told me to make sure I don't eat too much sugar. I'm not a sugar eater. I only eat it during Halloween and maybe Christmas. I became obsessed with counting every piece of sugar I could. Until those thoughts got blocked out by a new problem. It was always a cycle. 

I can't break it. Its been so bad that I won't even let my clinician change my medication because the last one made me gain weight and it took over my mind like a storm. A storm that may only stop when another starts. I tell myself it's just talk. I'm fine. Don't think, don't think. But thinking, you can't stop that. 

I even created my own separate personas in my mind, developed an entity for my mental illnesses, required music and books to keep my mind busy. But my father doesn't help. He has bipolar disorder, I'm not saying that being with someone who is mentally ill like yourself is unable to do, but he drives mine crazy. He has his own things he needs done. I don't like what he does. It brings more unnecessary thoughts. 

I think it may be hereditary. Me, my twin, my cousin, and my niece all show our own forms. My niece pulling out her own hair since she was only one. A thing my sister could never understand. None of us could. And what seemed to be a funny quirk of me wanting band aids all the time, was a show of the mindset that would soon drive me crazy.

How do you deal with others not understanding,"To start off I don't have OCD to the extreme, and it's much better than it used to be. That being said in my relative experience it has gotten pretty bad before (washing hands till they are cracked and bleeding, stuck in a loop until I cried, ruminating all day etc.) and one thing that makes me feel separated from those around me is the fact that they could never understand how bad OCD can feel sometimes. I'm not mad at them or anything as it's not their fault they don't have personal experience with it, but I can't help but feel frustrated and isolated because they haven't felt what I have felt. If this is a selfish mindset let me know but I'm just being honest.

Living with a relative who has OCD,"On mobile, never posted before but need  advice, I don‚Äôt consent to this being posted on any other form of social media

Every time I‚Äôm in a room with my mother, or when I hear her, see her, or think about her, I get an erection and my head fills with sexual thoughts. I hate it so much, I can‚Äôt deal with these thoughts and I don‚Äôt want them in my head at all. I just want to be able to hug my mom and tell her about my issues or something but I can‚Äôt without having my mind switch to something sexual. 

May it be while she‚Äôs in the bathroom my disgusting mind somehow wants to think about her literally pissing, or just while I‚Äôm sitting in my room and I hear her talking, I somehow think about groping her or something. It‚Äôs not wanted at all; I know I would never act on anything. But it makes me want to vomit and I still get an erection. 

I‚Äôve also had wet dreams relating to this and wake up feeling anxious and wishing that these thoughts could just go away. 

I know where this started from, when I was a horny 7th-8th grader I thought that it might be fun to try jacking off to everything, including her. I don‚Äôt remember what happened but somehow after like 5 months of me not doing it, these intrusive thoughts appeared in my head and have only gotten 100x worse. 

I‚Äôve also started to think of other things sexually, like a father picking up her daughter or some guy(even my father sometimes) or something. I don‚Äôt know why, but my head just thinks about the fact that they have a dick or something and it wants to think about that and it‚Äôs disgusting and I hate it. I don‚Äôt think I am a homosexual because I have experimented with my sexuality a fair bit. 

I have a past of sensorimotor OCD which lasted two months but once I realized what it was and dealt with it using tips I found online, it went away quite quickly.

I still watch porn but I avoid ones including mothers as they are a fetish of mine. But not my own. It makes me anxious and feel disgusted when I think about having sex with my mom now. 

I can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt get help because I cannot bear to tell anyone about this. But I need help somehow. So please tell me how I can fix this.",OCD,1584752410,Bokabshahhs,18,1,True,2020-03-20

Right now I‚Äôm so obsessed by WANTING TO SEE HIM!!!! Can‚Äôt think of anything else (except covid..). Can‚Äôt do anything. Can‚Äôt stop looking at messenger in case he‚Äôs online. Can‚Äôt stop.

Has OCD ruined gaming for anyone else?,"I wouldn't say it has fully ruined it for me yet but it has definitely given a severe blow to how much i play and enjoy video games. And i know this isn't as serious of a thing as the effects it has on my work and social life as well as my mind in general but gaming is my biggest hobby that i'm passionate about and love to do to relieve stress so it's so depressing to me how much my OCD has made it so difficult to enjoy it now.

Before i even had OCD (or before i knew i had it i guess?) and even the first year or two after i found out i had it, when it was still mostly just physical stuff like washing my hands till they almost bled i would do the usual OCD-like things in games that i think everyone does really, like saving multiple times in case the last save didn't take or just because and stuff like that but otherwise i was able to fully enjoy and play games. But now that it's grown with me and evolved kinda (a lot more mental things now like intrusive thoughts and other things that i look up to see if anyone else experiences every once in a while just to find out that it's a named and common thing for people with OCD like magical thinking to a certain extent) it's effected it to the point where i almost never play no matter how much i want to. The biggest thing stopping me right now is that i can't make accounts for any of the game systems i have without my OCD making me think somethings wrong with it in some capacity, either i'm not fully in love with the user-name/account name i chose and worry i'll hate it or want to change it some-day (which for some things, like steam, means creating a new account since you can't change the account name) or maybe i had a weird intrusive thought that day or something weird/bad happened that i don't want to associate with the creation of my account or a number of other things that ultimately end up with me deleting the account and deciding i'll start over and create a different account when things are going better or i think of a better account name i'll want to keep (i hate adding numbers after account names when they're already taken or doing weird letter brackets). I have every system to play games on, Xbox One, PS4, Switch and a PC But as of writing this i'm only able to play on my Xbox and it's been that way for a few years now with occasional attempts at making accounts for other systems that that might let me play and beat a certain game for like a week or two before i decide i need to delete it and then never touch it for another year or however long. I particularly pride myself on finally having bought and made a gaming PC which cost around $1300 in total and while i was able to play for a few months after building it which was great stuff like what i'v written above began to happen and i ended up stopping. I'v now had this PC for like 3 or 4 years and i can't even attempt to play it without almost having a panic attack.

But I've been thinking a lot. Would I even be able to drive with OCD?
I know that before you get a license you need to go to a psychiatrist, so they might diagnose me there. But even if they let me drive, could I do it?

but one thing i‚Äôve never quite let go was my death and illness anxiety. i started compulsively googling and going to doctors at a really young age. it got substantially worse when i turned 16. i was convinced i was dying of a heart related condition. i‚Äôve been to so many doctors and specialists in the past three years, and at 19, it hasn‚Äôt improved. if anything, it has gotten worse. it‚Äôs now manifested from solely ocd, to panic disorder and agoraphobia as well.

i have a dozen different symptoms a day, all of which convince me of imminent death. because that‚Äôs the root of it all. death. something that from 3 years old, i obsessed over. at that age, it was looking at pictures of gravestones and ghosts, my little brain unable to understand why i‚Äôm on this earth just to die. i guess i still don‚Äôt understand.

i consider myself agnostic-atheist. there‚Äôs some shit i really can‚Äôt explain, and there is a very real possibility of an afterlife. but for me, it‚Äôs more illogical than sensible. i wish i was religious, because maybe then i‚Äôd be less scared. people say that religious individuals spend their whole lives worshipping a god, and aren‚Äôt actually living. but hell, i consider what they do more living than me.

i‚Äôm so tired. so tired of waking up everyday knowing i‚Äôm going to have multiple panic attacks and obsessive thoughts. i‚Äôm tired of watching my poor family and boyfriend struggle to help me. i‚Äôm tired of relying on a benzo to feel like a normal functioning human for a few hours, but limiting how many i take so i don‚Äôt become dependent. and fuck, i‚Äôm tired of being a jobless burden on human existence. i‚Äôd kill myself if i wasn‚Äôt so fucking scared of it. that‚Äôs when you know you‚Äôre really trapped.",OCD,1584790035,likaachikaa,4,1,True,2020-03-21

"21 year old male diagnosed with OCD, obsession is fear of going crazy/developing Psychosis. Need some reassurance.","Hi guys. Almost half a year ago I had done ecstasy under strange circumstances which triggered a bad trip and I have never felt the same after. After a month I went to look for help since I still felt this way. I just couldn't feel anymore joy, suffer from derealisation since and had strange intrusive thoughts. Also started getting irritated quickly and sounds became louder. Couldn't concentrate and started analyzing every thought to see if I was going crazy. Sometimes when going to bed and closing my eyes I would see things and 'hear' random stuff in my head. They weren't really auditory but more like thoughts I couldn't control. Diagnosis eventually was an obsessive anxiety disorder. However, I sometimes still feel like they were wrong and that I am developing psychosis. I have these very strange deja vu moments where I know I haven't experienced it before but it's there. Or I feel a very dark feeling and randomly think of stuff I never experienced before. It's very frightening and it makes me believe I'm going crazy even more. Or my little brother tells me a story and I completely lose the plot and start thinking it's because of psychosis or because I'm losing my mind. I also suffer from intrusive thoughts that can feel so 'real'. Is there anyone who has had the same problems and could help me out?

Quarantine and ROCD,"Hi, guys. I've been doing better with ROCD in the past year, even getting to the point of moving in with my boyfriend months ago. I assumed it would be harder than it was, but I was able to manage my OCD thoughts well and noticed the thoughts were at a minimum. My therapist says I did a 180.

One of the issues is when we travel together, the thoughts increase. Maybe because I know we'll be alone together for a week or so. We just went on vacation a couple weeks ago and I was anxious, but it was manageable and had fun. My arousal went way down, unfortunately, even though I didn't want it to. I know thay was the ROCD. I still managed to have sex once.

But then we returned and had to be quarantined. It's been fine, but I've noticed a lot of ROCD intrusive thoughts, I think because I know we can't go anywhere. Because my health is bad from a pre-existing condition, I'm not sure how long we'll be isolated. 

My contamination compulsions are back, and when we first moved in together, I was able to be calm about things not being in the right place or order. It bothered me, but I shrugged it off. Now in quarantine the anxiety of it really gets to me, and makes me frustrated with him. On top of it, I've noticed how anxious and frustrated I get when he touches me. Sex has been to a bare minimum.  I'd love for our quarantine to be all fun and sex and relaxed, but my ROCD is telling me ""get away!""

My therapist is doing phone appointments but I don't know if I feel comfortable with it in case my boyfriend hears our session. I dont want him to be hurt or think the thoughts are real.

Any advice would be wonderful. Also, do you think responding to the thoughts with, ""I dont care"" will help? Thank you very much.",OCD,1584802371,Frprb99,0,1,True,2020-03-21

Zen poetry is amazing for OCD,"I don't have the argumentative skills to explain why perfectly, but I memorized plenty of Zen Poems that makes me feel better when my intrusive thoughts start to get a grip on my mind. Here are two of my favorites: 


""The wild¬†geese¬†do not intend to cast their reflection
The water has no mind to retain their image.¬†""

This poem helps me stop interpreting things. The same way clouds don't float in the air to be painted by artists, I remind myself that the world isn't there for me to interpret it. If I think something is bad (or good), the thought doesn't doesn't make it so. 

""Along this road
Goes no one,
This autumn eve"" 

This helps me feel better about no-one I know understanding what OCD is like, because we're all alone in our minds, and even though they can't understand what I feel, perhaps I can't understand what it's like to be them, or to be you. And it's okay, it's life.

My latest anxiety spiral was triggered by a bad reaction to an SSRI 9 months ago and has been complete hell. I've been dealing with terrible existential thoughts about consciousness, meaninglessness and the rationality of suicide.

I know I shouldn't go by the OCD stereotype of germaphobia but my mom is definitely germ phobic and has weird routines for dealing with anything related to cleanliness. 

She will break into an irrational frenzy whenever I don't do things her way. Like if there's dog poop on the sidewalk I have to walk on the road instead of on that sidewalk because ""what if people stepped on it and now they're tracking dog poop all over that pavement."" Or whenever she goes to the bathroom she has to step out as soon as she flushes because ""the particles will get on you"" (this is actually a fact however, that particles from your toilet do project a few feet when you flush) but however no one should be worrying about things as microscopic as this.

And with COVID-19 going on around now, she's broken into fully irrationality and is now believing anything she hears on the Internet, including conspiracy theories. And she'll get angry at me and yell at me for being dumb if I don't follow her ways of doing things. 

She will not admit that she is wrong/weird, and I honestly don't know how much longer I can cope without maybe getting some of her behaviors passed down onto me or just going insane.

Getting hung up about (small) violations of the law,"Hi, 

So I have a pretty strong ocd/anxiety disorder that usually flares up when I‚Äôm isolated for long periods of time without human contact (like now lol). 

One of the more anxious parts are when I get overly concerned if I‚Äôm breaking the law.

For instance, today I was driving around just enjoying myself with the sunlight and I went back to my old high school to reminisce in the parking lot (school is closed but people generally still jog around the school because it‚Äôs sunny). Now I remembered I had some dud disposable ecigs in my backpack just laying there for who knows how long and saw there was a trash can nearby. I took them and went outside and did a quick puff to make sure one of them was dead. And then I threw them away.

I‚Äôm now super worried whether I broke the vaping law on school property (I live in NY and I‚Äôm not sure whether there are cameras pointed at the parking lot) and idk seems silly but just trying to get perspective here and also learn how to not get super hung up and obsess whether I‚Äôll get in trouble with the law",OCD,1584831424,hemakesanon,4,1,True,2020-03-21

New to understanding OCD.. what has helped you?,"So I was recently diagnosed with OCD.. I have always known that I have suffered from depression and anxiety (since I can remember) - but finally owned it and decided to get help since starting university.. turns out I've actually been experiencing obsessive compulsive disorder all these years.

I am 23 and have basically isolated myself most of my life because of it.. I guess I thought that a lot of it was just normal anxiety and that other people manage or hide their anxiety better than me? Realising now that what is going on for me is a lot more complex than that, and I feel overwhelmed and relieved at the same time. Finally caring about myself enough to want a better quality of life.

I don't entirely understand it all yet.. I am slowly becoming aware of my compulsions and obsessions now that I am aware - I find they are waay more intense when I become stressed or uncomfortable in any way.. but they just feel so natural to me because they're things I've always done.

I am wondering what techniques have helped you, and if any of you can recommend some books or resources that have helped you on your journey? My gp wants me to give Sertraline (Zoloft) a go - which I am a bit nervous about it but I think it is important to give it a go. I exercise and meditate regularly, and am also seeing a clinical psychologist.

Would really appreciate any advice anyone has! I don't have a lot of people in my life to talk to about this stuff, and I feel a bit alone in it (and a bit freaked out if I'm honest).",OCD,1584837681,druiidae,2,1,True,2020-03-21

Compulsive teeth brushing?,"Alright, so I've never formally been diagnosed with OCD, and I have no intentions to claim I have it. I came to this subreddit because I figured you all probably have some experience with compulsive behavior, and might be able to help me understand better. In my experience, I've always been told OCD is compulsive behavior with some sort of mental belief that compels compulsions. Rather than just compulsive behaviors. Personally I have a tendency to wash my hands compulsively (which has been great since this virus has been going around ahaha) as well as a finger biting habit that fits under the ""dermatophagia"" umbrella, and I've been told is compulsive, an odd bandaid thing.. I always have bandaids on my fingers because I bite them, and if I touch anything with those bandaids I have to change them, or I get severely mentally uncomfortable, and then my newest habit is compulsive teeth brushing? I was curious to know if that's actually a thing? And also if these things I've described are actually compulsive behaviors, or if I'm getting the wrong idea entirely. As far as the teeth brushing thing goes, I've been brushing my teeth after every meal, snack, drink, and sometimes even out of random. In total I probably have been brushing them 7-10 times a day. I also wanted to know if anyone knows if this will damage my teeth in any way? Should I try and stop, and maintain the 3 times a day schedule I had before? Or leave it be?

(pocd) Is this normal to feel if I have OCD?,"Before initiating this post, I want to say that I have been to 2 different psicologists (non-ocd specialists) and both have diagnosed me with OCD. I'm female in her 20s and I'm queer. I'm on medication and I haven't had therapy for 5 weeks due to the pandemic. 

-

Is this normal in someone with pocd? 

- 1. the immediate confusing feelings when I see a child: I know I sense confusion, fear, panic, intrusive thoughts, etc. 

- 2. To be more ""fearful"" of a certain gender? Like, my ""ocd"" fixates more on girls. 

- 3. Does ""false attraction"" exist on a person with ocd? I don't really know what attraction truly is and I want to believe that my brain shapes that confusion into fear but I can't be sure... 

- 4. Groinal responses, even arousal? 

- 5. small urges or impulses? This doesn't happen very often but it happened last night when I watched a movie and it scared me so much... 

- 6. I feel like a ""p"" but at the same time not? Feeling like I'm in denial? 

- 7. Fear of ""if p were OK in our society, I would be one"" 

- 8. Fear of having done something in the past and I can't remember or I'm in denial? 

I think I'm forgetting something... 

I have been feeling so poorly and so afraid... I am returning to my old state. My state of ""I can't leave the house or I will a child or I will do something wrong"" - I think the fact that my mom is pushing me to get a job is doing me harm...

I don't know what to do. Ocd Therapy isn't a option here because my country doesn't offer it...

Possibly misdiagnosed with ADHD and stimulant medication making compulsions worse.,"Six months ago I started seeing a psychiatrist for the management of my mental health in relation to medication as my GP was having difficulty. I have depression and since seeing my psychiatrist have been diagnosed with binge eating disorder and ADHD.

I am currently prescribed 150mg Venlafaxine and 50mg Vyvanse. He initially only wanted to prescribe Vyvanse for my binge eating but couldn't get approval unless it was under the diagnosis of ADHD. Prior to this ADHD was never brought up. I don't relate to the symptoms and feel like it was fabricated or has been misdiagnosed. The treatment for binge eating disorder has been his main focus and I feel like he tried to make the ADHD symptoms fit leading to a possible misdiagnosis. I should also mention I cannot afford a psychiatrist and my GP is the owner of the clinic whereby this psychiatrist works from and has done me a favour in allowing me to be bulk-billed by him so a second opinion isn't an option. 

Since starting the medication it has stopped the binge eating behaviours (as I have no appetite) and I feel like my depression has been better from the Venlafaxine. The only side effect I can note from the Venlafaxine is low libido which is another issue in itself. However, it has amplified my compulsive behaviours - skin picking, biting the skin around my nails, cutting my nails too short, obsessively popping pimples, plucking hair, biting lips etc. I am covered in scabs and my nails are infected.

I think I have it,"For a long time in my life I have felt anxious and depressed. I used to get upset by small things and started isolating myself from other children. I was terrified of upsetting my teachers because, to me, they were big adults with big voices and whenever they told off the troublemakers in my class I used to get something of a panic attack and feel really stressed for the whole day.

In high school I went through two breakups with ex-girlfriends, both of which triggered my depression through a long time. Now I‚Äôm in university and I think I‚Äôve gotten a better handle on my life and keeping myself calm, but I recently learned more about OCD symptoms and I suspect I could have it.

Last year I lived at home with my parents. I was depressed out of my mind and was worried I might go crazy, if I hadn‚Äôt already. I felt violent urges and once spent a night taking them out on cane toads (they are environmental pests in my country and killing them is encouraged here).

I had thoughts of killing that bothered me. Thoughts like, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt hold your baby sister or you‚Äôll end up smashing her face into the floor,‚Äù and ‚Äúif dad annoys you again you‚Äôll stab him.‚Äù

Other thoughts I had were those of people harming me.

Being outside in public I constantly wait for somebody to mug me, yell at me or attack me. When I am with my girlfriend, I sometimes have thoughts that someone or several people will come along and try to harm us and take her away from me.

 One day, my dad asked me to help him put up some fences. I went out and he got his sledge hammer and asked me to hold the post steady while he hammered it. After completing two posts, I ran inside after I could no longer fight the thought that my father was going to hit me on the head with the sledgehammer. 

There are other things too. I find myself washing my hands without even realising I‚Äôm doing it, and the double washing them. Another big on I realised it that I hyperfoucus on things like how I look while walking.

The fact that I dropped my own pet goldfish into the floor and didn‚Äôt bother to pick it up makes me worry I‚Äôm a sort of psychopath, because I heard somewhere that ‚Äúpshycopaths can‚Äôt keep pets.‚Äù The goldfish was fine, for those wondering. My dad saved it.

"I‚Äôm realizing I have time-consuming behaviors but I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre associated with specific obsessions, should I bring this up to my therapist and how?","Hi! So I don‚Äôt want to put myself where I don‚Äôt belong and I really don‚Äôt know much about OCD and am not saying I have it or think I have it by any means, but I wanted to ask about this in a place that may understand. I do have severe anxiety and moderate depression that I‚Äôm on meds for and seeing (now phoning?) a therapist weekly for. 

So I have these repetitive behaviors that are all essentially about removing tactile imperfections, I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm forced to do it out of anxiety, I just find it a comforting thing to do and once I start, it‚Äôs very hard to stop. For example I used to spend a ton of time plucking every tiny minute hair out of place, not because I‚Äôm concerned w the appearance to others, but because of the tactile sensation of something being out of place. It was never at the point where anyone would notice because I would avoid areas like my face and scalp. I‚Äôve also picked at skin on my hands and made my skin bleed from this since I was a kid, though that‚Äôs gotten worse in the past few years. 

I‚Äôve been trying to stop doing these things because I‚Äôm developing this noticeable patch on my palm from where I pick my skin and people have started asking me about it. Since then I‚Äôve transitioned to another similar thing. I have this fluffy/ fake fur type blanket and pillow that I have on my couch all the time. At each seam there is fur in caught in the seam, and I take tweezers or a comb and pull all the fibers out of the seam. It doesn‚Äôt damage the blanket or anything but I spend like hours doing this in the evenings, to the point that my hands hurt. 

I‚Äôve brought up the palm thing with my therapist before but never any of the other stuff because it‚Äôs super hard to explain and, as someone with social anxiety, I can‚Äôt help but worry that my therapist will think I‚Äôm weird (I know this is dumb).

It is the one obsession that never goes away, with intrusive thoughts I can understand that they are not real and I am not a bad person because it‚Äôs just my illness, but with this it is something I really did. The guilt drives me absolutely insane whenever this obsession rears it‚Äôs head, and it makes me want to harm myself as a compulsion. However these days I can stop myself before it gets to that point. Is it possible to be traumatized by something like this, even if it‚Äôs something I did to someone else? 

Separate thought, I have also at around age twelve been groomed online by sexual conversations with adults and am wondering if this could have also caused ocd? It has not rlly resulted in any trauma though.",OCD,1584862276,gothampxt,3,1,True,2020-03-22

Help with Compulsions!!!,"I have an issue with my OCD where basically, when someone close to me, like my parents, say something to me that sounds negative, I bring it up with them and ask them to say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù

Derealization &amp; intense fear over developing psychosis/schizophrenia,"Hello! I came across this subreddit after a recommendation and I'll share my story here.
My fear got to a point where it's obsessive and I can't stop thinking about it. I'm ruminating about it all day.
It's a pretty long post but please read til the end if you understand this situation.

Simply put, it's just as the title says. I've been dealing with symptoms of derealization and depersonalization over the time and this year it has gotten more intense.
It's because I started focusing so much on my mind for fear of developing psychosis and/or schizophrenia. 

I'm 23 year old, female, last year graduated from art college and currently unemployed but I work as a freelancer and get commissions here and there.
The thing is, after falling into the trap of googling my derealization symptom last year, I came across schizophrenia and early signs of psychosis. My mind got a thick dark cloud around it ever since.

I don't have any family history of this disease, however I have some childhood trauma due to my abusive father (more like, verbally), the divorce of my parents, my twin brother getting diagnosed with epilepsy and exposure to the health problems of my grandparents (we all lived together and I loved them very much, and it was hard for me to see them in pain). Because of all these experiences, I've always been in a hypervigilance state and FORGOT HOW TO LIVE.

I've been dealing with health anxiety, agoraphobia and panic attacks since highschool (since I turned 17 or 18 more exactly).
The derealization I felt here and there wasn't something I was as concerned about as I am now but lately it turned my daily life upside down. I'll get to it a bit later.

So, after graduating college, I took a break in my hometown that summer since my mind was fully occupied with my bachelor's degree project for a couple of months.
I haven't done much for me, haven't been out much due to my agoraphobia and most of my friends living in other cities, the only way of socialising being online.
I tried sticking to different routines but they all failed in august. My derealization feelings came back and started googling about it. As I mentioned earlier, I came across psychosis and schizophrenia. I GOT FREAKED OUT when I found out the age onset is usually between late-teens to early 20s. I'm 23 and very scared about it. As I said, I have no family history with the disease and don't have either hallucinations or delusions, but reading all of the symptoms I got very hyperaware of my thought process and began questioning my thoughts and doubting myself a lot. I'd get thoughts like ""What if i'm imagining this? What if i'm hallucinating this? What if it's not real?"". Deep down I know they sound ridiculous but I can't help and get scared to why do they come in my mind.
Fast forward, I took my concerns to a psychiatrist in december and after telling him everything, he told me that there's no sign showing of having psychosis or schizo, especially because I was very fluent and articulate in my thoughts. He said that if I had it, it would had started earlier on, when my personality started shaping or something. 
He however diagnosed me with severe anxiety and panic attacks and gave me some medication. I couldn't take it, cuz it worsened my anxiety but I agreed I would seek a psychologic therapy instead.

Time passed until I decided to finally make an appointment and when I went to my first session, the clinician psychologist mentioned that, from what I described her, my main problem that i'm dealing it would be PTSD from all my trauma and derealization would come from there.
It made a lot more sense, but I still couldn't get the thought of my head about the age onset on developing psychosis/schizo. It was shown everywhere I went through sites and formus.

After the corona break and being forced to stay in quarantine, things got worse. 
I feel like everything feels surreal, like i'm living in a dream. I feel so disconnected from myself and surroundings. Everything feels foggy and it's like i'm looking THROUGH things, not TO things...if that makes sense. My attention is so focused on my derealization/dpdr that I started to forget words or not find the right words when talking to my family. My speech feels forced and doesn't come out naturally.
I'm so scared of losing my mind and going insane. I haven't used to be like this. I got very insecure and vulnerable, it's like i'm just existing but I can't feel the present moment. I also spend all my time on my phone in my bed and this fear messed with my daily routines.

Does this sound to you like anxiety or something more severe? I'm honestly very scared and fear opening up to my family about it.",OCD,1584892245,dawnelenor,14,1,True,2020-03-22
Ever fear you're dating a sociopath? Is this common?,"I've (20F) seen a lot of people say they fear they themselves are a sociopath but does anyone struggle with the other way around? I've read about it being some kind of relationship OCD but for example, I worry that i'll get stalked, abused in any form, that i'll end up dating a narcissistic sociopath and suffer. I worry that all the kind things someone i'm with has ever done or said to me was fake and that i'm being tricked or manipulated and I don't see it. I imagine they'll flip a switch and all of a sudden will be bad to me so I constantly obsess about their actions or the things they say and wonder ""is this a red flag,"" ""is this a sign that they're not good,"" ""are they treating me right or are they pretending"" etc. It's hard to tell if these are true concerns and that my gut is telling me they're not good or if it's my brain being paranoid that people are out to get me. 

The person (22M) i'm currently in a relationship with has treated me better than any guy I've ever been with but he's really charming and anytime he says ""you're the most beautiful girl existing"" or if he acts cocky/conceited at times i worry that i'm being fooled. He's a bit of a loner too and doesn't talk about how he feels a lot so it makes me question further. He told me the other day he shoplifts when he can't afford things and I thought ""is that another sign of a sociopath."" I was studying psych and he asked me how a sociopath would be treated and that made me think ""maybe he's curious for a reason"" I feel like i'm constantly thinking of the list of characteristics of someone who has aspd or what people always label a sociopath and I over-analyze his behavior.

I fear that I'm secretly a paedophile,"**PLEASE DON'T NOT READ IF YOU'RE OCD IS CURRENTLY BAD, THIS MAY TRIGGER YOU OR YOUR OCD MORE!!!**

I'm worried I might be a paedophile because I sometimes masturbate to cartoon porn that has characters that are 13 or 14 years old in it. I don't directly look at an image of the porn, instead, I imagine it in my head. I know they're not real, but it still makes me seem like I'm a paedophile. Basically I think of the cartoon characters doing sexual acts with each other. I often think of two or more cartoon characters having sex with each other and that they're all females. So, it's lesbian cartoon images in my head that I masturbate to. I always maturate to females. Then there's the fact I might be a bisexual. 

One side of my rational brain is saying ""you're not a paedophile."" Then the OCD side says I am! I'm scared because it feels like I am one.

I'm not worried about masturbating to characters that are clearly above the age of 18 years old. But this has worried me a lot since yesterday.

My health OCD is so bad right now. I am convinced I am dying at least twice a day.,"I just don't know how to deal right now. I know everyone is having a bad time and especially OCD sufferers are having an even more terrible time. I think I just need to vent.

I  have always had an obsession with my health mixed with a good part of hypochondriasy - so I have a nice mix of intrusive thoughts that I know are untrue/esxaggerated but I can't shake and actually being convinced that I am sick and will die. From thinking I have a heart disease, to brain tumor to, most recently, being obsessed with my mental health and thinking I had BPD and keeping on questioning myself whether or not I have OCD - I have basically had every health related obsession you can name. But Corina is new. Its this new terrible obsession that drives me crazy
Because I can't perform my compulsions (mainly reassurance), because everyone else is freaking out, too. I can't find any satisfying internet resources, because there aren't any. Instead I am flooded with forwarded message from strangers that ""know exactly what is going on and what we have to to"". Which honestly sounds just like the things my head makes up to convince me to perform my compulsions.

I am freaking out because no one knows how high the risk really is. How many infected people go unnoticed. I am convinced I have it since three weeks. Everyday I wake up and think, today is the day my lungs will collapse and there won't be resources in the hospitals left to treat me. My throat has been feeling strange for weeks. I have allergies, so that's probably why, but _what of not_. I have a hard time breathing and I am weak, I can't walk for longer than 15 minutes without being exhausted. I feel like I can't breathe sometimes. But all of that is also symptoms of panic that I know far too well.

I can't stop ruminating about the question whether or not to call my doctor. Unnecessarily taking resources from my doctor or having Corona and being unnoticed? Will I die if I don't call? Will anyone else die? Should I confess to everyone I know I am feeling strange? Who do I already have killed because I just can't find an answer to that question? Getting tested or not? What if, what if, what if. My head is spinning and I am breathing heavily again just typing this. I guess I'll just die anyways when the system breaks down completely. Recession is inevitable they say. Financial crisis feels so real. It all feels so real. I fear losing my job and can't stop thinking about everything we have built up over the years to fall apart.

Am I gross or was I just stupid?,"So this was like 4 years ago. When I was 16 I was hanging out at a friends house. I think we were playing card games. They were all older then me except for my friend‚Äôs little brother. I think he was 12 but I‚Äôm not sure. 

Anyways he asked a question like ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs a pole dancer?‚Äù Or something like that. I thought I was being funny by do a bend over move.

Info on Startup Costs for Treatment?,"I‚Äôve done research and asked friends regarding costs of therapy and medications, however, there seems to be a lot more to pay for aside from calculating/budgeting a monthly cost of therapy + meds: the initial doctor appt, exams to rule out a physical cause, subsequent doctor visits upon starting meds, etc.
I view my situation as the same as not having insurance, because even though my insurance costs over $350 a month, it doesn‚Äôt cover anything until I‚Äôve spent the first $6,500 out of pocket, and only after that is there some form of a deductible to pay instead for therapy or doctor visits.
My question is, would it be possible to get an (however rough it may be) estimate on what the start-up costs add up to after you‚Äôve gotten to the point of establishing your therapist and getting your first prescription filled? (Assuming insurance doesn‚Äôt cover anything) Would you say it easily exceeds a thousand?
I‚Äôm asking because I don‚Äôt want to get the ball rolling only to have to back out because it‚Äôs going to cost way too much *before* I get to the point of therapy &amp; meds...and then I‚Äôve spent hundreds on nothing.

Cheating/false memory,"Hi all,

Hoping for some guidance/support

Two weeks ago I went out and got really drunk. I was texting my bf throughout the evening. But the last bit of the evening I went off grid and really cant remember anything. About a week after the night out I had this ""memory"" flash up of me thinking to myself, as I was making my way home from the night, ""right, that's it, it's over between me and my bf"" like I knew i had done something bad and that I had to go back and deal with that/tell him. To be clear, I have NO memory whatsoever of cheating on him, just a horrible feeling that I thought I knew I had on the night. I've tried to reassure myself that if i had of cheated then I almost certainly would've told him when i got back &amp; also wouldn't have rung him and told him about my taxi etc. I also think some sort of sensory memory would come into play e.g. remember flashes of who it is that i kissed. but as rationalising myself down from this thought works temporarily, every so often (e.g. about every 5 mins) that horrible gut/guilt feeling comes back suddenly and flashes in my head. I also felt extremely anxious for like a week after the night out. 

Has anyone else dealt with this kind of thing? I know by telling him I would feel better but I also know that is reassuring seeking and doesn't help in the long run (as I'll just move on to something else)",OCD,1584904260,CoolProfile,6,1,True,2020-03-22

My roommates moved out and had random people move in during the corona pandemic,"Hi, I (F 22) am a long time lurker but a first time poster. I have struggled with OCD since my childhood, it involves cleanliness but also the counting of all of my belongings and knowing they are in their place. I don‚Äôt think it really bothers my roommates, I just ask that they don‚Äôt enter my room without me being home. All of the furniture and dishes and blankets and such in the common areas are mine (my family is upper middle class and did not mind providing me and my household with our furniture and common area needs). I try not to let my rituals involve the things in the common areas as not to disturb my roommates, and if I do count it is at late night when no one can see me or be disturbed. In fact, I hide my OCD so well that a previous roommate claimed I made it up just so I could make up a ‚Äúrule‚Äù that no one could go in my room or share my clothes. I assume yall know how important it can be to hide your OCD rituals from the people around you, as there is an inherent embarrassment surrounding mental illnesses. But i digress. As everyone here probably is aware, this COVID virus is like a living hell for those with OCD, all our ‚Äúirrational‚Äù fears are suddenly rational, going against years of therapy. Well my roommates are brother and sister and decided to move out and have brand new people move in all within three days (they wanted to move back home during the corona virus pandemic). My mother and grandmother are immunocompromised (and we live in the same city), so I had to make the choice of leaving my home and staying at my parents, or not coming into contact with my family indefinitely seeing as these two new roommates are random and from out of state (and I cannot guarantee they have not been in contact with the virus). I feel lost without my belongings to count and without my sacred space where my OCD felt in control. But also I am very close with my family and am used to seeing them at least weekly. Now I am afloat at my parents house with only a suitcase of my stuff and random people enjoying the comfort of a home Ive lived in and furnished now for over 2 years. Do I go home and just not see my family indefinitely? Do I stay here and just wait out the pandemic and hope these random strangers do not upset my belongings trapped in my house without me? I know this seems like a silly worry with everything going on, but I thought maybe this would be the place where I am most understood.  Because honestly with the anxiety of the corona virus, my OCD anxieties are at an all time high (which I know may be displaced anxiety). My mom has made it clear that if I do choose to go back to my house, I am not welcome back I‚Äôm her home indefinitely as we do not know where these girls have been and they are most likely not self isolating (as most college aged people really are just partying right now). Every day I have woken up here has felt like a dream and I close my eyes and visually count all my belongings at my house, even though I am not there, and hope these random people are respecting my belongings and house. I understand my roommates leaving on one hand, but also this is the last act in a string of selfish acts (like randomly bringing home a dog after your roommate (me) has expressed they have OCD and cant imagine the mental toll of living with a dog. To this my roommate, who had been a best friend since childhood, told me he simply did not care enough about my needs to sacrifice his wants. I wish I was making this up). I don‚Äôt know I just wish they had given me more options and cared more about how their actions during this pandemic would affect their childhood friend with  OCD who they lived with. They just packed up left and had new people in the house all within a matter of days. However I am aware that they did what they think was best for them and I respect that, their utter lack of respect for what is best for me or even my family (and they know my mom and grandma are not well) sucks coming from longterm ‚Äúfriends.‚Äù Some advice or encouraging words about how to get through this without finally losing my mind would be so helpful.

"How can I get help for my brother? (sorry if the flair is wrong, asking for support but gets a bit venty in places)","Even before the COVID-19 crisis, my brother seems to have developed an obsession with contamination over the past year or so. He washes his hands so much and will freak out if he considers something 'dirty'.  I partly blame myself as I do similar things, but to a much lesser extent. We both avoid touching the floor like the plague and wash anything that touches it. However, I have much milder symptoms and less obvious coping mechanisms (for example, always wearing sleeves that are too long for me for door handle touching purposes). But his has gotten to the point where it's a huge problem. His hands are always horribly cracked and bleeding and I've woken up at 4AM multiple times to hear him pounding at the soap dispenser trying to put far too much on his hands. My parents, who are usually decent people seem to react to these anxiety related issues by yelling at the problem. I'm writing this after I heard them yell at my brother for not wanting to pick up a dressing gown that had touched something it shouldn't have. 

I wish there was some way I could get him to get help. My parents seem to think just showing him how people live in far dirtier areas and making him do more cleaning will fix stuff. But that's the problem. If he's anything like me, I know I'm being irrational, so rationalising the issue doesn't help. That's why it's a problem. My brother would never willingly go to a counsellor or therapist, but if I bring it up with my parents I will most likely get yelled at. Especially with the COVID-19 thing going on, I've been getting a bit worse recently too, and I worry that I'm setting a bad example.

PASSWORD CHECKING,"Hi guys, just wondering has anyone else suffered from this

This is a different compulsion but its really been getting me down during quarentine! 

I broke up with my ex boyfriend about a year ago and during the time of our breakup I had an awful habit of logging into his account because I still knew his passwords. His passwords ranged so I was able to get into pretty much everything. I eventually had to tell him and he changed them. A couple of weeks would go by and the thought would pop into my head and I'd have to check to see if I could get in or not sometimes I would and sometimes I wouldn't. Eventually it became a continous cycle of me logging in and him having to change it. The minute the thought would come to my head I could't relax and would always have to check. Summer came along, my life got better and my ocd disappeared. I then met my knew boyfriend.

 After about 4 months in I told him how password checking was something I used to suffer from and unfortunatly that triggered me into checking passwords for relief and I ended up getting into my exes snapchat even though I thought all his passwords were changed!. I told my boyfriend and he got mad ovbs and now I can't stop checking my exes passwords again. He hasn't changed anything back thank god but the thought pops into my head and I have to check even though I know its been changed. I'm so scared of lossing my current boyf that I have to prove I dont know the password. I find myself thinking oh maybe its banana and then I can't convince myself that its not banana so I have to try banana and then when it says password denied I feel relieved. The checking has gone past regular apps such as snap and insta and has now gone into random things such as paypal. I can't seem to stop and my therapist is MIA due to coronavirus so I haven't been able to discuss this with her!! 

I do not care about my ex but its just a compulsion because its something I dont want to know and I'm worried if I know it will make my boyfriend break up with me.

Someone please help.,"So I have OCD, and I get those bad intrusive thoughts that plague me constantly and give me anxiety. So in 8th grade I had a girlfriend, we dated for a week, broke up and then she moved away. That was it for a while but someone told me that she was talking trash about me before she moved and I started to get anxious because I just imagined stuff I made up in a mind that I thought she was saying. I felt anxious for a while so I got the guts up to text her and she replied and we were good again. We even FaceTimed a few times until we just stopped talking. She still lives in a different state but for some reason I still fell really anxious about the fact that she hates me for some reason even though I never did anything to her. I‚Äôve already told myself that I wouldn‚Äôt text her again because I don‚Äôt know if she has a boyfriend, or got grounded, so I don‚Äôt want to bother her. I don‚Äôt like her like that‚Äôs anymore, and I‚Äôve already got confirmation that we were good by her texting me back, but I still feel anxious about it and just want everything to stop.

Contamination OCD and Sex,"Hi everyone, much love to everyone during this time in our world.

I made an account here just to ask a few questions during my self isolation. I'll make it super short.

I have some aggressive contamination OCD, I was diagnosed about a year ago. It has absolutely ruined my sex life. I went from having a very healthy sex life, and then BOOM \*the event that launched the aggressiveness of the OCD\*, nothing. Even thinking about sleeping with another person sends me into a state of panic over all of the things that could happen to me and my health. Things that are likely entirely in my head.

I'm unable to sleep with people unless they get tested before and share the results with me. I like to think that if I am comfortable enough sleeping with you, there should (hopefully) be enough mutual respect there that this isn't an issue. I just haven't actually been able to bring this up to any potential sex-mates because I'm worried it will be seen as invasive. I guess I'm just looking for opinions on that.

I am only 20, which makes me even more worried because in the world where casual sex is so easily accessible and common, why would anyone want to go through all that trouble just to sleep with me? I welcome all opinions or potential ways to get over this and just be able to date normally. It's really fucking with me.

\*Also I am not at all trying to demonize any type of std or those who have them. It isn't just STDs at all. I make people wash their hands three times before touching me. Rinse their mouth off with water before kissing me. I have to file and clean my nails before I can even masturbate.\*",OCD,1584925183,okkoyellow,0,1,True,2020-03-22

Ocd clonking me in the head and I can‚Äôt conquer it,"So my anxiety is getting pretty bad again. My ocd is acting up. Lately I‚Äôve had my ex best friend in my head all day.

Losing her was one of the toughest things I‚Äôve had to deal with. All while juggling my ocd. Which she didn‚Äôt even know about. Nor would she care at this point.

I‚Äôm really struggling and in need of some advice,"I was just diagnosed with OCD two weeks ago but I have been experiencing the symptoms for more than two years. I tried to hide it but I ended up caving in and telling my mom. I struggle with contamination, counting, and symmetry. The contamination is the worst out of the three of them. 

Here are some problems I am facing :

-I can‚Äôt eat anything that is not in a package because I feel like it is tampered with or poisoned somehow

- I have to prepare my own meals. I can‚Äôt eat family dinners

-I am basically living off of yogurt cups and hot pockets right now. I can‚Äôt bring myself to ingest anything else because that is all the packaged food in my house. 

-I have safe foods and unsafe foods. Let‚Äôs just say that the unsafe foods are the majority of foods

My mom also struggled with OCD for a while but it is now more under control. She is the only one who truly knows what I am going through. 

I have an appointment with my therapist on Tuesday. This is my second appointment so I am not sure what I should really expect out of it or when I should bring up the stuff I just listed. I don‚Äôt really know if I want to continue with the person I have right now because she starting asking really personal questions right off the bat about my self harm. I know she has to ask those things but I am very shy and have difficulties opening up to people and trusting them because of my childhood abuse. It just kind of made me uncomfortable. 

 I need my family to understand the severity of my issues. My stepdad and 4 siblings laugh at me whenever I tell them that something is bothering me. Other times they are just plain mean about it.

Here are some instances :

-One time, I was in the kitchen with my oldest sister and we started fighting about something dumb and she spit on me and said ‚Äúaww why don‚Äôt you go and act psychotic and wash your hands with bleach again‚Äù

-This evening, I refused to eat the family dinner mainly because my older sister stuck her hand in the food (and I really wasn‚Äôt going to eat it anyways). My twin sister starting yelling at me and saying ‚ÄúYou are making everyone uncomfortable. You need to stop being so overdramatic and selfish all of the time.‚Äù

-My stepdad constantly tells me about how many germs are on any item that I have touched or am touching just to get a reaction out of me. When I get upset after he tells me these things, he starts laughing at me. I‚Äôve told him to stop numerous times but he never does.

-When I get on my older sister‚Äôs nerves she says things like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to go spit on your bed, toothbrush, clothes‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to go rub all of these dirty dishes all over your bed.‚Äù 

I guess, in summary, I just need help getting over my phobia towards unpackaged foods, help with how to address my family, and some advice on how therapy went for some of you guys so that I can kind of figure out if it will help or not in the long run.

Just wanted to bring this back up for any of you fearing about developing schizophrenia, bipolar, or any other disorder with psychotic features. The main reason a delusion or hallucination is labeled as a psychotic symptom is due to an alteration in perception and an inability to gain insight. So think about it, people with delusions may genuinely believe the CIA is following them everywhere trying to catch them and feed them to aliens. It's a fixed false belief, and nothing that you can do can convince that person otherwise. That is their reality.

On the 11th I started, as I was told by my doctor, taking 5 milligrams of Abilify (Aripiprazole) and 2 milligrams of Tavor (Lorazepam) for my OCD. The 5 mg of Abilify were for my OCD symptoms and the 2 mg of Lorazepam were given to me to calm the anxiety that apparently Aripiprazole gives. This was my first time ever taking medication for OCD and my doctor told me that we'd, most likely, go to 15 mg eventually of Abilify and that we'd also decrease the dose of Aripiprazole. After calling her on the 19th (cos of Corona virus I can't even meet her if it's not for emergencies, I'm from Italy) and telling her that I didn't notice any contraindications but my OCD hadn't changed, she changed my dose to 10 mg of Aripiprazole and 1 mg of Lorazepam.

Horrible Guilt OCD please read!,"Hi im a 17 year old with horrible ocd amongst other mental illness that makes my ocd worse. Since I can remember, I have gone from horrible obsession to horrible obsession. Currently, I am struggling to function happily with everyday life and my relationship. I am currently dating a girl I know I'm going to marry and early on I made mistakes like flirting with other girls, using some video chat app for masturbation, and porn without her knowledge. Some people may not think these things are big deals but we are very committed to each other and these go against our boundaries. I hid them from her when they happened and soon forgot about them for many months. One day recently I began to remember them and started having extreme guilt OCD that was eating me alive. I began to tell her everything I remembered and then from there everytime I thought I remembered everything some random minuscule detail of one of the things I did that I was feeling guilty about would pop up in my head and make me feel worse which would start the pattern of bringing up these things to my girlfriend again and hurting her all over again. Thankfully I remembered everything I had done wrong and told my girlfriend all of this, however The guilt that resulted from the OCD hasn't subsided at all. I would like to make clear I'm not open to SSRI'S I love shrooms and pysches for mind expansion and healing but sadly I can't trip everyday. This is the only relief I have gotten from my OCD. I dropped out of high school at 16 so I work a full time job, so now my OCD guilt tries to make sure i'm never doing anything wrong like flirting with customers and it feels like a game of chess because my brain will convince me im doing something wrong when im conscious enough to know that I am not. This OCD has huge effects on my relationship because not only has it hurt my girlfriend but i'm constantly stressed out, asking for reassurance from her, and its hard to feel love when all I can feel is a panicky feeling in my chest from guilt. The only relief I know works that I have access to is Xanax but that is a whole different issue because I struggled with a mental addiction to it and my girlfriend is very protective and gets upset when I bring it up because she doesn't want me to rely on it again. I would like to know if any one has any natural coping mechanisms besides THC or shrooms which I do occasionally for spiritual reasoning. Anything will help whether its a mental coping mechanism or some sort of herb or literally anything.

Things have been so rough for me. I had a plan, I was going to the gym, I was planning meals. Pandemic hits, all hell broke loose for me. It doesnt even feel like this is reality right now.

I want to call my doctor and get meds. Ativan to be exact. I need a brain break. But I'm constantly obsessing if I'll become addicted. I'm on clonazapam and zoloft daily, I'm not looking for reassurance. I know my family doc knows what is best when I talk to him. I just dont know guys. This shits been so hard and trying to find my path back to a healthy lifestyle just feels so overwhelming and difficult right now. 

My own relationship problems, my ocd, my panic. It's all coming at full speed right now. I dont feel like a functioning adult anymore. God. 

I try my best you know, stay positive. Help others. It's been a rough go. I know we will all get through this together. It's been a hell of a two weeks.

I forgot to mention my two week long peroid and how I just got my iud out and my hormones are fucked. Cherry on top of my shit cake. Send help lmao",OCD,1584952964,khalessitos,1,1,True,2020-03-23

Tips for maintaining mental health when swapping medication OR during isolation?,"So i'm swapping from sertraline to clomipramine. I am SCARED but trying to not be (and trust God). I have to go off of my medication to start clomipramine, which means several weeks with low/no meds, and waiting for the clomipramine to build up enough to work. I haven't been off of meds since this time last year and it is BAD.   
During this time, i'm staying home most of the time, church is cancelled, volunteering is cancelled, i'm unemployed, etc.

I get it. This is reassurance. But I seriously believe I will (harm OCD urge) and have attempted numerous times. How?,"I've went to 2 psychologists, I have a postpartum care team consisting of a psychiatrist and a social worker. I've went to my doctor. My parents know. My close friends know. I'm doing cognitive behaviour therapy and ERP. I'm taking Luvix 150 mg. I make sure someone is always by when I am alone with my baby.

But nobody is afraid to leave me alone with my baby. And nobody is afraid of me. No matter how often I warn them. Which, judging by my boyfriend's response...is frequent. Apparently I tell my spouse and my Mom that I'm on the verge of acting everyday. I was with him mostly alone (with someone in the house) all day tending to him. 

My brain is completely broken. 

And when I look online, I can't find others like me. Everyone seemingly *knows* they wouldn't act on their thoughts.  I do not. In fact, quite the opposite. 

I tell my spouse. He tells me it's just my OCD. I told the psychiatrist. He says it's really severe OCD. 

There is a chance, deep, deep down, that I know I wouldn't act. There are periods of rationality.  

But my brain over rides it. And it confuses me, because with ERP, how far is too far? If I have the urge, when do I stop and go: ""HELP!!! I'm about to act!!"" But I have. Thus far. And if I attempt anything new or unplanned, my brain guilts me. 

And it's just impossible. The guilt from trying to expose myself. I always have an excuse from why I've never acted. But it's never good enough. No amount of evidence is good enough. 

Yet, the fact I have a mental illness keeps me going because it sometimes absolves the guilt. The fact that I sought help, quickly, to prevent anyone from getting hurt and said my thoughts, my terrible, consistent thoughts have kept me going. 

And this is somehow terrible OCD. No hallucinations.  No voices. Just strong urges and thoughts and guilts. 

I just want to keep going. I dream of the day where I'm back to only having thoughts on occasion.  Where I always understand that it's just OCD bullying the Hell out of me. Where I understand that no matter what, every new, outrageous urge, doubt, sensation...it's all part of OCD's terrible, hellish game. 

I've went off topic. I just so desperately want someone who genuinely understands the severity and Hell right now. I am not dismissing the hell of OCD with less severity. I understand and hope I'm not special. I just can't find that reassurance online and I feel alone. So damn alone while so damn not. 

Thank you.",OCD,1584957133,bloodrein,8,1,True,2020-03-23
Intrusive thoughts about women feet,"So I am not a foot fetishist. I am a straight male. I like Women.

Once again, I am not a foot fetishist and I am not aroused by feet in any way.

(pocd) is this normal to feel if I have ocd? Pt2,"Tw: pocd, s-x, masturb-tion, drugs metaphors 

Info: female, 20s, pocd since early-mid 2017

This is something weird to talk about or even describe but the first time I masturb- (it was an accident and I was 20) it felt like a ""drug"". The first few times were new and interesting (again, like a drug) and then I spent the rest of the time trying to recreate that 1st time by doing all sort of things (I'm still a virgin and I didn't do anything weird). This may be a weird metaphor but when people do drugs some move to worse ones and I'm so scared that deep down I want to do it with kids to get that 1st time experience. Does this make sense? The idea is so disgusting, I know... My brain does not stop coming up with random things to worry about. But this was one of the reasons why I stopped masturb- completely (I did for 3 years and I stopped completely at July 2019 when my ocd got worse). And I'm so afraid to have intimacy one day because I'm afraid it will awaken me to something worse... 

I just... I'm so sorry...

Do ""p"" know right away that they want what they want?


(I'm so scared... Please don't hate me... I am so scared of everything.)

I never mentioned the above idea to that extent to my therapist but the trigger to my pocd was masturb-tion because I started associating all bad things with it.. I think my brain started thinking about s-x more and it connected to bad things. 

I wished I remember the 1st time I thought I was a ""p""... I'm so sorry for not remembering it...

"It's being impossible to overcome a particular OCD thought, resulting in headache and fatigue.","I was diagnosed 3 years ago with OCD, all related with order and perfection. I also had o*bsessions related to the body*, but over time I got over them. 

The point is that about **8 months ago**, I started to have **low levels of myopia (no need for glasses)** and then I started to **strain my eyes** all the time to see everything in more detail. Today the obsession has worsened, preventing me from doing my daily life and forcing my eyes to see better even when I am in home. 

There are minor concerns such as *""if you force your eyes you will end up going blind""* and things like that, which I logically understand to be intrusive thoughts and ignore them. But that obsession to strain my eyes to see every detail has become automatic. I had similar obsessions, like the feeling that an air bag is filling somewhere in your body *(body related OCD)*, but back then you could decide whether to move that part of your body or not. In this new obsession you **cannot decide whether to do it or not**, simply because of the biology of the eye, **it is done automatically when you think about it.**

During this quarantine I want to learn new things and not be idle during the day, but it is very difficult for me to have this almost automatic thought.

Sense of mental isolation,"For me, one of the worst parts of dealing with OCD is the sense of mental isolation. Sometimes it causes me to literally isolate--being so numbed and depressed by it that I don't want to talk to anyone about anything for some time. 
But another type of isolation comes from knowing I will never share my intrusive thoughts or compulsions with anyone other than my ERP therapist. I know that sharing them with anyone outside a trained mental health professional would probably be disastrous--people would misunderstand or freak out. Yet sometimes it just isn't enough to tell ppl ""Oh I had another OCD episode"" and call it good. Or when I'm on Twitter and vaguely mention OCD and the problems it's giving me and leave it at that. 
So this leads to a mental isolation where I feel close to bursting from having these thoughts and almost no one to discuss them with. I'm certainly grateful i at least have a therapist to talk to about it, at least--I realize that's not the case for so many people with OCD.",OCD,1584977032,EthanHNelson,1,1,True,2020-03-23

I'll keep it brief and to the point. I'm a female and I'm 20 years old. 

I masturbate on a daily basis and sometimes when I do, I masturbate to my thoughts or the images I see in my head. They can sometimes be about real people who are my age or similar or they can be cartoon characters/anime characters. Some of the characters are aged between 13 to 14 years old. I sometimes masturbate to the characters having sex with each other. In my opinion they don't look their age and they look older than what they are. Sometimes I realise this is weird and it scares me because I think I might be a paedophile. And then sometimes I pretend their 18 years old older (to make it legal).

"Need help, I'm still having medication contraindications after stopping taking them and I'm freaking out","Hello. On the 11th I started, as I was told by my doctor, taking 5 milligrams of Abilify (Aripiprazole) and 2 milligrams of Tavor (Lorazepam) for my OCD. The 5 mg of Abilify were for my OCD symptoms and the 2 mg of Lorazepam were given to me to calm the anxiety that apparently Aripiprazole gives. This was my first time ever taking medication for OCD and my doctor told me that we'd, most likely, go to 15 mg eventually of Abilify and that we'd also decrease the dose of Aripiprazole. After calling her on the 19th (cos of Corona virus I can't even meet her if it's not for emergencies, I'm from Italy) and telling her that I didn't notice any contraindications but my OCD hadn't changed neither, she changed my dose to 10 mg of Aripiprazole and 1 mg of Lorazepam. That's where the problems started: I started having so many contraindications that on saturday I stopped taking the medications.

Problem is that, as of now they're all gone except for the tremors and I'm freaking out because I'm afraid they won't go away and I'll have them for the rest of my life. When I type on PC or smartphone I press the key twice or I don't press them at all (because of them), in fact it's hard to write if I don't go slow.

Do I need a new therapist?,"My therapist is a nice person. I‚Äôve been seeing her for about 2 months now and do feel that I‚Äôm making progress with my OCD.

However, I sometimes wonder if her behavior is unprofessional. For example, on two occasions, while I was in the middle of talking about something very difficult, she pulled out her phone and to reply to a text from her daughter. I understand that having a teen (I think about 14-15 years old based on what she said) can be stressful, and I‚Äôm sure she wants to know what she‚Äôs doing at all times. Each time she has done this, she has said, ‚ÄúOh sorry, just my daughter texting me.‚Äù But last time she changed the subject entirely after that because she obviously hadn‚Äôt been listening to what I was saying, which I found unprofessional. Or she will say, ‚ÄúSo, where were we?‚Äù IDK, YOU TELL ME, you were on your phone. üòë It also didn‚Äôt sound like it was an emergency either, her daughter was just texting her her whereabouts. But I don‚Äôt have kids of my own so maybe I don‚Äôt understand. It just seems like she would be more present when each client only gets an hour a week of therapy time. 

I also don‚Äôt like how she will talk about things that feel meaningless to me sometimes. Like she‚Äôll ask me questions about work that don‚Äôt have much to do with my OCD, almost like she‚Äôs my friend and we‚Äôre catching up over coffee.

On the other hand, though, talking to someone about my problems has helped my OCD. I am seeing improvements after every session. And I‚Äôve switched therapists so many times that I‚Äôm sick of starting over. So, for those of you that go to therapy, what do you think? Is she being unprofessional? Do I just not get it? What do I do?

Getting my doctor to anti-anxiety medication?,"22/F

200mg Sertraline 

Hello,

I have been suffering with contamination obsessive-compulsive disorder for a few years. I just started cognitive behavioural therapy in January and was making great progress. The COVID-19 pandemic begun, I have lost all my progress and cannot even leave my house to go for a walk. I had completely eradicated some compulsions completely as well. My anxiety is heightened, especially with all the cleaning products being sold out. I have very intense panic attacks everyday, nightmares and trouble sleeping. 

I have tried Trazodone for sleeping but I had adverse effects. It gave me terrible headaches. I have a fear of vomiting with my OCD and it made me feel sick. I know that everyone is struggling this time, but my mental health is seriously impacted and it has become beyond my control. I am slowly weaning off of my 75mg dose.

I would just like to have some calm. So I can use this time to work on some compulsions in-home and be able to get some fresh air while I can and be able to sleep, eat and function like normal again. I have done my research on Lorazepam and I think this medication would be the be the best for me short-term.

I called my clinic for an urgent care appointment and the doctor on call was seriously minimizing my panic. I told him all of this and more. I did not ask for Ativan. He suggested that I take melatonin and said ~stay strong~

I called my GP, told her the same thing. She said it‚Äôs normal to feel this way and said to work on my sleep hygiene. 

I do have a particular schedule, with a routine so I‚Äôm not sleeping in or on my phone screen all day. So it‚Äôs not bad ‚Äúsleep hygiene.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know what to do now... I am worried this will impact my last semester of university which has transitioned online now. I am afraid that not going outside will effect me badly. I am afraid I will never be able to go outside ever again after this is over.

I feel like it sounds drug seeking to outright ask for Ativan, and I know doctors are reluctant to give it. I don‚Äôt smoke weed for self medicating so there‚Äôs nothing I have that makes me sleepy. What should I do?

Also thinking about everyone on this subreddit during this time. It‚Äôs such a difficult time for us. The government isn‚Äôt really doing anything for mental health initiatives, there will be repercussions from this isolation and fear.",OCD,1584988528,babydoll_wav,0,1,True,2020-03-23

Tips for intrusive thoughts that are longterm and deep down?,"Hey y'all, does anyone else struggle severely with some intrusive thoughts that are so deep down and particularly traumatic that it seems like they'll never go away? I have had particularly stressful situations throughout the years and I eventually get over them, but then find that they're just waiting for me to worry about them again. There are certain intrusive thoughts that are so bad that I even got worried about them on my wedding day and proceeded to lose an hour of my life worrying. That made me feel very bad in particular, causing more intrusive thoughts, but I have to remember that that is not indicative of any of my feelings and only the result of OCD triggers.

I feel like I'm making progress in therapy, but even when I do good work at ignoring intrusive thoughts on a day-to-day basis, there are still those underlying huge thoughts below the surface that I worry that I'll never get rid of. They are all thoughts about things that I cannot revisit, so there's some lack of finality to each situation that brings OCD into the question.

Afraid of being a bad person and losing my mind.,"I struggle with anxiety for whole my life, but the last few years it became unmanageable. I lost my job, friends, studie etc. Basically everything. Slowly I became more agoraphobic and currently I even struggle with taking a single walk. On average I leave my house only once in 2 months for the past year. I got depressed because this as well. 

I‚Äôm basically 24/7 busy with my own mental health. I am trying to figure myself out, but I‚Äôm failing in it. Because all of this is going on for quite some time I feel like I don‚Äôt even know myself anymore. I‚Äôm afraid of being a bad person, but in what way I‚Äôm not sure. It does feel extremely strong. I start to avoid the smallest things like watching a movie, drinking a cup of tea (caffeine) etc. Even in things where I don‚Äôt necessarily know a trigger in are things I‚Äôm uncomfortable doing. My hobby music for example, is affected by it as well. Probably also because of my depression, since I just don‚Äôt feel it anymore. I feel uncomfortable around people, even my own family. I‚Äôve started to think it might be a fear of being possessed or something. That‚Äôs like the most fearful thing I can think of. It‚Äôs incredibly frustrated of being anxious, but not knowing where you actually are afraid of. I‚Äôm afraid of losing my mind and control, but sometimes I worry that I might already have lost my mind. I don‚Äôt know exactly who I am besides all of this anxiety. I feel like I can‚Äôt even trust myself anymore. It‚Äôs horrible. Derealization increases everything as well. I just have all of these strong uncomfortable sensation constantly. Like I don‚Äôt belong on this planet. I‚Äôm constantly analyzing everything I feel and think. My confidence is just completely gone. I don‚Äôt know how it is to feel good anymore. 

Does anyone have any advice? I‚Äôm currently waiting on therapy, but it is delayed because of the virus. I‚Äôve been diagnosed with panic disorder, depression and symptoms of ocd. Is there any hope for me? I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore.",OCD,1584993992,Amygct,3,1,True,2020-03-23

- trouble multitasking

- problems completing tasks

"I'm new here, welcome me to the club. I want to share my experiences.","Hey there my OCD brothers and sisters.
I'm 19 years old(soon 20) and I've had this OCD thing since I was a kid but it would show itself in different ways and forms.

No my OCD isn't about frequently cleaning my hands or place, in fact I'm the messiest and dirtiest piece of human garbage you're gonna meet in your life.

But I've been diagnosed with ""biological OCD"", means it's inherited, I trusted the doctor's diagnosis since almost everyone in my maternal side has it.
My cousin is a married father of 2, but he has this obsession that his parents are about to die at any moment, he calls them every minute to check up on them, my other cousin takes showers all the time because she thinks she's dirty... the other cousin thinks he's gonna catch HIV at any moment lol
It would be a book if I wanted to write about the obsessions of every single member in my maternal family.

But anyways let's talk about mine

I got this obsession where I would think that my brain cells would die if I get exposed to chemicals etc, also I don't drink or smoke because I'm afraid they would cause brain damage(even tho I know people who binge drink every weekend and their thinking is healthier than me lol)

I'm a classical guitarist who loves his profession, this means I have to memorise a lot of shit and playing instruments(the professional way, not as a hobby) in an academy requires a lot of brain power trust me. So don't judge me if I'm too afraid to ""lose"" brain cells lmao. 

But about a month ago I got an RSI(repetitive strain injury) from practicing too much because I had to perform in my university. I got micro tears in my forearm muscles from overuse. They healed in a week or two, but then I got diagnosed with very mild Thoracic Outlet Syndrome which is tingling in the tip of my left hand fingers caused by pinched nerves and veins in the neck.

The TOS is gone now but still I can't stop these thoughts that come and go, I keep thinking that I've done irreversible damage to my physique and that I won't be the perfect virtuoso guitarist I wanted to be anymore, these thoughts are driving me crazy... I keep thinking that my TOS is about to come back at any time :(

But the good thing is that after my new obsession, I forgot all about my previous obsession(brain cells and stuff)... Does anyone else have this problem? The problem of new obsessions taking over the previous obsession?",OCD,1584999677,Adhar_Ducks,1,1,True,2020-03-23

OCD Targets Whatever You Prioritize,"This is the weird and uncanny way in which OCD works. And over years of struggling with OCD, it's actually caused me to look at life in a very different way......and regular people just don't get it.

For me, my OCD keeps changing. It targets whatever I prioritize. It's almost like when I set a goal to myself and want to focus on it, my OCD observes it and wants to take my happiness away by making the goal the new obsession.

Here's an example: I struggled with social anxiety in the past, but I got over it. Then my OCD switched to something else. During this phase, I actually became more social. I became more social because I found that talking to people, going out to clubs distracted me away from the OCD and it felt nice. So I became very social and my confidence was booming at this point.

Then later on, I discovered the importance of socializing after I found out what I was missing out on. How important it is health wise, and mental health wise to regularly socialize. And then I gave it priority. And then guess what. My OCD creeped into that and made that the OCD. Now my social anxiety is back and its actually worse. Ever since I realized the importance of socializing, I am now having trouble doing it. It's like a force that pushes back.

"Andrew Reynolds and ""The Madness""","Hello OCD community,

I don't have OCD but I experienced subtle impulses when I was younger that definitely tried leading me in that direction, so I *kind of* understand. 

[This is a video about Andrew Reynolds, who is a professional skateboarding with OCD.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWUHOpHII4A) I'm not sure if it has been posted here before, but I found it fascinating and would love to hear the thoughts from people with OCD.

The fact that he'll land an extremely difficult trick, but then ""have to"" do it again because he wasn't satisfied with how it looked is just crazy (no offense guys!). Maybe it's just because I'm used to hearing how OCD is about the little things. Does anyone have examples of how it affects your life on a larger scale like this?

Thank you for taking the time to read this.",OCD,1585013869,idontdodrinks,0,1,True,2020-03-23

Reading OCD,"For all my issues with OCD in the past 14ish years, this is quickly becoming one of the most annoying. 

I think it was the end of 2017 or 2018 when I first remember having to re-watch a scene from a Metal Gear game on youtube because I didn't fully understand what a character was saying. 

To be fair, that game is full of confusing dialogue.

But since that time, it's just gotten worse and worse and worse. 

Now it gets involved constantly. Any time I'm reading anything remotely important. 

If I'm reading bullshit on the back of a cereal box, I'm totally fine, I understand it completely.

But if I'm trying to read an important text message or a line of dialogue in a subtitled show I'm watching, I may have to go over it a bunch of times, and may still feel like I didn't understand it at all. 

As far as my stellar run of luck goes, I finally got a nice job for the first time in a number of years and it is perfect for aggravating the OCD.

Basically I have to make sure things are correct on a form before I file it, and I could spend anywhere between a few seconds to a few minutes on just checking one date. 

The numbers match up, I even know them in my head, and I'm still looking at them over and over.

As fate would have it, I'm finally being told to stay home due to the whole virus thing, so I'd like to take this time to start fighting this shit tooth and nail.

Because as annoying as it is at work (to the point where it slows down my workflow), it's also affecting my attempts to relax.

I bought the new Animal Crossing and I gotta say that it is an enjoyable game. I'd be enjoying it a hell of a lot more if not for my stupid, stupid disorder. 

I'll try to play the game out in the living room while my mom watches TV, something I was able to do with the previous Animal Crossing a number of years ago, but now literally everything distracts me and prevents me from focusing. So I end up eventually having to go into my room to play.

In my research to figure out how to fight this, I found this from psychcentral.com:

""The treatment for Reading OCD is the same as for all types of OCD ‚Äì exposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy. Ideally, the person with OCD works with a competent therapist using ERP, which involves doing the opposite of what OCD demands. So no rereading and no avoiding reading. One example of how this might be accomplished involves covering up words already read and not allowing yourself to uncover them to reread.

So without rereading, how can we be sure we really understand everything we read? Well, we can‚Äôt. Certainty is an elusive goal and part of ERP therapy is to accept that; there is very little in all of our lives that we can actually be sure of.""

Support,I‚Äôve been struggling for a. Few months now. I was diagnosed with ice anxiety and depression. Most recently ocd in November. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I feel nothing and almost think I‚Äôve avoiding every sensation. A twitch a tickle an itch everything mKes me nervous. I think my I ocd centers around harm to other. It‚Äôs probably my fear that I‚Äôll explode in anger or hurt someone. I‚Äôm also addicted to that narrative. And I feel very stuck in the thoughts. I don‚Äôt have thoughts that pass by I just avoid thoughts and feelings all together and now I‚Äôm quite scared of how that‚Äôs going to let go. I am so tightly wound and exhausted.

I dont know if I'm in the right place.,"And if I'm not, please point me to the right place. I've known my husband since we were 12. We are 26 now, married with 2 kids, and he was diagnosed with GAD, OCD, and BPD two years ago. When we first started dating he was really bad off, and I forced him to seek help or I told him I couldnt be with him anymore. I was pregnant and I was so stressed I nearly miscarried due to his behavior. He got help, and had made a ton of progress regarding his BPD and GAD. He was only recently (again, two years ago) diagnosed with OCD and while he doesnt have many specific rituals, he is VERY particular about just about everything. At this point, I'm going to very honest and please dont bash because he is trying, he doesnt take his medicine that is prescribed and he doesnt see a therapist. He works 60-80 hours a week, and I'm working when he isnt. We literally dont have time or extra money for him to regularly see a therapist and he hasn't found a doctor who he is trusting of yet for meds. I have learned to live with how he is, I will help him in any way I can, but I guess what my question is, users with OCD or with loved ones with OCD, what can I do to help him have a smooth day and not completely melt down? We have good days where everything is good and then others are just....impossible. Again please dont judge me, or him, we try our best and we have worked through a lot. He is a totally different person (for the better) now than he was a few years ago. Even without medical intervention he has taken up meditation, and other coping relaxation methods to cope with his issues but I just wonder if there is anything that helped someone else that we could try? I just love him dearly and I want to help him however I can without forcing him to do things he cant or doesnt have the time to go do.

How do you continue dating when HOCD hits?,"I have been struggling with HOCD and to make matters worse, a pretty bad breakup as well. My therapist has been urging me to try dating again, but I legitimately feel as though I don't know how attraction feels anymore. Everyone and everything stresses me out/depresses me. I see a guy that I think is handsome or nice and my OCD tells me that's a lie I'm telling myself. I see a girl who's pretty and my OCD says I want to sleep with her and will be terribly unfulfilled and sad until I accept that. 

When i was in my relationship, one of my compulsions was looking through nsfw subreddits that my bf liked and comparing myself to the women there. I used to (and still do) see those women and think ""oh wow of course he would be into that"" and am genuinely struck by the sex appeal some women have, particularly because I don't consider myself very attractive or desirable. Before HOCD hit, I never even considered that that might be attraction, but now I worry that because I notice these features on women or have any response to the images at all that I must be a lesbian.

My 2 month long asbestos journey that is coming to an end (I am already starting to feel a lot better),"Ever since December I have been obsessing over asbestos because of my house which is very. Very old that has been falling apart. There were some shingles that fell off my roof and into my yard and they were the old ones and may have contained asbestos. I got really anxious about this and had to call my dad to come clean them up. When he came he was asking what the big deal was and that even if they were asbestos it's not gonna hurt me.

 Then, my kitchen ceiling was leaking and there were holes everywhere, the pipes were the original ones from whenever they put them in and I was scared that there was asbestos pieces on my kitchen floor that were from the pipes (they used to rap the pipes with asbestos). 

And then there was another hole in my ceiling next to the stairs that fell about 6 months ago, and I didn't care much at the time because I wasnt aware of what asbestos was, and since December I was freaking out about it because I saw a cement looking thing in the hole and I thought it was asbestos and I would hold my breath whenever I walked by the hole.

 I got the holes fixed and was acting like a complete freak during the process of fixing all this and stayed at my parents. There was little bits and pieces of the ceiling all over because the contractor didn't fully clean up and I was freaking the fuck out because I thought that there were asbestos pieces all over my floor. (Like pieces of the ceiling that could have had asbestos on them) 

And you want to know what happened? I found out that after all my freaking out, hysteria, anxiety that THERE was no asbestos (atleast where I thought) after going down a huge rabbit hole I found out that my house was too old to contain asbestos and that any asbestos in the house would be from renovations that were done after the house was built (house was built before electricity and plumbing were a thing)  so the only parts of the house that could have contained asbestos were the original electrical wiring, the pipes very well could have contained asbestos, but they most likely didn't. 

But, here's what I did find out, there's a chance I may have been exposed to huge amounts of asbestos in this house months ago. I ended up finding out that the roofing was redone about 15 years ago and they just had a bunch of cheap laborers do it, and you're supposed to build over the old stuff but these people just ripped out the old shingles. Okay so? Well here's the thing, the attic has no insulation, you can see the shingles from the attic. The entire artic floor is probably filled with asbestos because of the old shingles that were ripped out, and I cleaned the attic really good and remember breathing in tons of dust and having to shower to get the stuff off of me. 

The thing is, the actual slight possibility of asbestos exposure I may have had I don't care about, mainly because it was before I was even aware of what asbestos was, therefore there was no way I could have known any better and stopped myself. It's only after I found out about it that I cared. 

What makes it even worse is those shingles were apparently asphalt shingles, which according to many websites are the shingles that commonly contained asbestos.  

There's still a huge chance the the original home owners (who I am related to) were able to go an entire 130 years without using an asbestos product anywhere during renovations.

The point of this post? A vent on my end. And I guess a reason as to why you shouldn't overthink stuff. If you're exposed to a toxin you are exposed to a toxin. There's really nothing you could have done about it, you can not control a world that is out of your control.  My fear of asbestos is coming to an end because the house is pretty much done with repairs and I am just gonna try to avoid going in the attic in the future. I already feel a lot better with the house fully cleaned, and am excited to go back to normal living without having a stupid fear of asbestos.",OCD,1582003809,adammartin99,0,1,True,2020-02-18

Obsessions that are uncomfortable but pleasurable,"Hi,

I‚Äôm trying to figure out if I can simultaneously like my obsession and act on it, and despise and want to avoid it at the same time. I couldn‚Äôt find anything that seemed to include this particular experience on any med sites, but I haven‚Äôt got a clue why.

I greatly deplore my obsession, but I‚Äôm also extremely fascinated by it and get an adrenaline rush from acting on my thoughts.

My obsession doesn‚Äôt involve harm to others (as far as I know, at least not directly), so I‚Äôm not worried about criminal activity or anything. It‚Äôs just a nuisance to me, and involves a fascination with demons. (The only way I can explain this simply is that I have intrusive thoughts about communicating with and having experiences with evil spirits. This has been happening since I was twelve, and it was just as infuriating as a non-religious person as it is as a religious person now.)

I‚Äôm not afraid of my obsession, the thoughts and even the actions, though I 100% believe that it‚Äôs wrong. This last time I caved into my urges, I didn‚Äôt feel any remorse for it, whereas I always feel guilty before almost crossing the line. Why is this so?

The only thing stuck in my head is my obsession today, and how pleasurable the intrusive thoughts are. It‚Äôs causing me much anxiety. I‚Äôd rather not act on them, but I love to. I‚Äôm torn and feel like a war is going on in my head.",OCD,1582006454,ShadowsWithinMe,3,1,True,2020-02-18

Irritated with my brain today,"I have to say that I have never been officially diagnosed, but have been pretty certain for over almost a decade.

I compulsively pace while listening to music and thinking about my obsessions, and act on my impulses and thoughts when I decide I don‚Äôt want to fight them anymore. I‚Äôve done this for almost my entire life. It‚Äôs extremely ritualistic and I have only met one other person who does such a thing. I always feel distressed and embarrassed before and after performing the action, and it typically occurs as a frenzy for at least two hours per day.

I‚Äôve tried to get a formal diagnosis in the past in vain, and I did attempt therapy through my university, which I hated. I can not afford paid help at this time but really want to.

I have literally hours and of homework that‚Äôs due tomorrow, and no desire to do anything. I came home from a long weekend of work (worked around 32.5 hours in three days) and my brain crashed within an hour of being home. Literally was sleep deprived (by necessity due to travel time) that whole weekend and exhausted, and somehow my frenzy kept me up until 7AM yesterday, despite a long month of sleep deprivation before this weekend.

I think stress does trigger me, but it always seems unrelated in the moment. I had a terrible bout last week right before this job for no apparent reason. It was so bad, I was giving into my urges related to my primary obsession. My anxiety relaxed and I felt no guilt, despite the fact that I believed that my actions were wrong (in the religious sense).

On top of that, I‚Äôm trying to release from an accident where I almost lost a family member close to me and the stress of that that‚Äôs come on my family because he basically is coming to live with us due to his mental state. 

I‚Äôm also having difficulty driving due to what I originally thought was vertigo, but has now become convulsions and twitching reactions to motion and light (possibly seizures, but I don‚Äôt know whether to hope it is or it isn‚Äôt. I‚Äôve been to various doctors regarding this issue because it impacts me daily and none of them have been able to figure out what‚Äôs wrong with me yet).

I‚Äôm feeling depressed today and completely unmotivated. I want to quit school and give up, even though I have no debt and only have about a year and a half left (I started in 2015). I just got semi-guaranteed a job after this weekend, but I‚Äôm scared I may not be able to pursue it because of my mental state. I certainly don‚Äôt want what happened to me in high school to happen again where I fell off the deep end. I literally dropped out of school my junior year and basically disappeared for 9 months before getting my GED. I was a straight-A student prior to that mess. Thanks brain.

Ugh, it just all sucks right now. I‚Äôm trying so hard, but I‚Äôm overwhelmed by stressors and life events. I‚Äôve wanted to sleep all day today, but can‚Äôt seem to fall asleep.",OCD,1582007689,ShadowsWithinMe,3,1,True,2020-02-18

Alot of my ocd is about past mistakes and wrongdoings, its so hard to ignore those thoughts just because they are based on something that did really happen in the past.  


One that came into my min today is about a incident when i was about 21 - 22 yrs old. (im 32 now btw). Me and some friends of mine were in a bar having alot of drinks and even some dr\*gs were involved (i know thats bad). at some point a friend of mine got into an argument with another guy or group en this got out of contro lreal fast and before we knew it they were rolling on the ground fighting, i remeber that without any hesitation i threw a punch towards the head of one of the guys (its very blurry to remember since its so long back and i was quite intoxicated). after that i really dont remeber much and everything went by in a split second until the bouncers were there and threw us out.   


But now like 12 years later i feel huge amounts of guilt like, what is the person i might have hit went paralysed by that? or even died or traumatized? did i hit the right person? or was he maybe not involved and innocent? well i can keep going on and on. i know aggression and violence are never ok but it was a split moment decision where a friend of mine was being attacked (atleast that is how i remember it). i have never ever been in such a situation again and i really dont like aggression or violence. actually im a very peacefull person and i feel a big inner struggle about this situation. anyone got some advice?",OCD,1582012665,tunux,2,1,True,2020-02-18

Cheating and OCD.,"Hi all,

Last year, I was approached by a married woman. I did NOT know she was married and wasn't particularly into it at the start, but we started dating anyway. After a few dates I found out she was married. We had gotten a bit intimate up until this point(we had kissed). I still stayed in it for a few days(and had sexted) but ultimately backed out of it and we stayed as friends. 

This was a bad idea as she was interested in me whole heartedly and I liked the female attention I was getting from an interesting woman. But I made a clear boundary that I cannot be anything more than friends. She would text me about her woes and it eventually started getting intimate on text so I backed away again and told her to back out.

Few months ago she started contacting me again and this time I gave her a hard NO. 

Should I tell the husband? I have diagnosed scrupulosity and Pure O so this was a death spell for me. I have been wracked with guilt and can barely function. Please let me know what you think.",OCD,1582032318,saitama695547,0,1,True,2020-02-18
Do any of you guys find yourself obsessing/fixated on uniformity/grouping/theming?,"Hey everyone! Just wanted to get some feedback on some recent things in my personality that at ive discovered that I couldn‚Äôt find a word or anything for.  It‚Äôs honestly tough to explain, but growing up did any of you guys have an odd fixation on consistency, uniformity, being able to compare as well as being drawn to ‚Äúsmaller‚Äù details of things? For the uniformity/consistency/comparisons question for example I was never drawn to logos or designs of logos themselves. Instead I had a sort of a weird need to make sure some car manufacturer was consistent in using the same logo or a mountain bike company used that exact logo on the front of their frames. Another more recent example is I‚Äôll find it so cool how a company like Red Bull has two f1 teams. I like seeing the two cars side to side and will spend a couple of minutes on Instagram to find like a cool side by side photo otherwise I‚Äôll just give up and not think much of it. Things along those lines with many many other things growing up. As for being drawn to smaller details I was curious if you guys get your attention grabbed by things like the armor set or weapon of a video game character and looking up stuff about it/comparing said sets and weapons and often playing games to just use those weapons and armors (while still enjoying the game of course). I guess the same would apply for movies and enjoying those suits/armors/weapons and characters and often comparing them to a close rival or within a lineage. Sorry if this post is inappropriate. Just needed to see if anyone else experiences this. Don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs some sort of OCD or autism, or whatever. Thank you for any and all feedback!

I was diagnosed with hemorrhoids, they dont hurt, they dont bleed, but they sometimes make one little tear which itch. The tear is really small and doesnt cause any pain, its gone the next day and the itch is like 5 seconds of the day and I have it once in a two months I guess. The thing is that I am scared to go on toilet, I am scared to walk, I am scared to do any move because when I feel itch even tho its my hair which is normal I get huge anxiety and I want to kill myself. The thing is that I am scared everyday. Even through the tear is not there. Most od the time my anus is okay, but I am so much focused on it that I think i have it everyday. My boyfriend tries to reassure me by taking a photo, and today is the day, when I got little tear again. I felt like two second itch and it drives me crazy. I feel like I cant do anything now because of that. I cant excersise, walk, take a shower. Every second of the day I think about my anus. Its insane. If I see on the photo there is nothing, itch stops. If i see there is something, its itching even more. I dont know what to do. I was normal girl and now my world is just my asshole.

Advice obsession with childhood,"I have sufferd from OCD for the majority of my life with my obsessions mainly revolving around things like leaving taps on, leaving keys out at work or leaving my front door unlocked. As I have exited my teenager years I feel my obsessions have taken on an entirely knew and frustrating angle.

It started around 5 months ago in which I was out drinking with my farther, he was telling me about my sister who was at a festival. I began to worry about her taking drugs or being hurt and messaged her for a bit. I then came home and watched a movie with my flatmate, in the movie there was a scene of a brother threatening a sister.  I was suddenly hit with a memory of myself at a much younger age kissing my four years younger sister and the question of ""have I abused my sister coming into my head. The memory seemed so real and clear and I had suspensions I had had this memory flash in my mind a few months prior to this.

This sent me on a downward spiral, I began to believed I had done much worse things to my sister such as rape or molester her when we where both children with images and general feelings of dread filling my mind. These thoughts came so quickly and felt so real and valid that I spent days in panic not leaving my room. I couldn't keep this to myself so I told my mother after a few days about the thoughts I was having. She of course was shocked and confused as to why I was bringing up these ideas. She reassured me she would have know if I had done these things, she also asked my sister about this and if I had done anything wrong to her. My sister was also confused and said no I had never done anything bad to her.

This however has brought me no certainty or peace of mind. I keep finding new ways to justify these events as real with thoughts like my sister was to young to remember, my mum could have not known and generally why I would initially have these thoughts in the first place. It may be true I kissed my sister when we were young something I have learnt to accept,But I can gain no certainty that I didnt do more than this with her and even worse if I did it with multiple people.

Im posting this to gain some advice or perspective around these thoughts and how to possibly deal with them. These past months have been hard waking up every day feeling like a rapist and a monster and no matter what logic or belief I apply that I didn't do this, I cant drop this feeling of dread that im in denial or making excesses for a terrible thing I have done.",OCD,1582045550,Spitsfire82,3,1,True,2020-02-18

The serial killer Ed was the one that made me the most uneasy, I hated his actions and in my mind, he‚Äôs one of the worst possible things a human can be.

Today is really hard,"I do a lot of checking on this one thing online and I had my husband block it this morning. It really isn't healthy or safe and I want to stop. I'm so uncomfortable right now. I feel like something bad will happen if I don't check, but I'm not sure what. I know that isn't rational. I'm just so anxious right now! 

On top of that I haven't heard from my best friend in ages, I sent her a text weeks ago that said ""are you ok?"" and one a couple days ago that said the same. I sent one today that said ""if you don't want to talk to me that's ok, but please tell me directly. As it stands I'm really worried about you. You know I watch a lot of true crime!"" and still no response. I'm afraid she is mad at me because I said it's not a sign of a healthy relationship for her and her boyfriend to be breaking up and fighting all the time. That or something bad happened! She's a bartender which can be dangerous, plus she and her boyfriend fight and she's a prior survivor of domestic violence from another guy. 
This morning I sent her boyfriend a linked in request because I don't have any of his contact info and I don't have social media. I just want to send him a message that says hey, is (name) ok?

Is it possible to overcome reading and checking compulsions through self-help and without a therapist?,"Hello everyone,

I have been struggling with reading and checking compulsions combined with intense perfectionism.

I re-read what I have just read, feeling anxious about either not comprehending or forgetting what I have read. Sometimes I repeat the whole paragraph, and sometimes only sentences, not in certain magical numbers, but until I have the ‚Äújust right‚Äù feeling, you know, because the feeling of discomfort and incompleteness is intense.

The same applies to listening to podcasts and watching documentaries/movies etc., but fortunately I have not been giving in to compulsions and rewinding podcasts/movies as I used to, and it feels really good. It was way more severe until a couple weeks ago. However, the issue with reading is going on.

I know this repeating disorder is common, and I have seen many posts by former sufferers of this particular problem declaring their victory after working with a therapist and doing ERP.

So, is it possible to get over compulsive reading and checking by applying ERP and reading some good self-help books, and maybe some mindfulness, without the help of a therapist?

Is it all about building your specific hierarchy and so forth?

I have other OCD symptoms that vary in form, would a self-help book and ERP help with them too?

Some say that you do all the ERP yourself and the therapist is there to help you identify your symptoms and move foreward when you feel down. Would someone with good knowledge of his symptoms benefit from bibliotherapy and ERP?

What would former sufferers of compulsive reading behavior think about the possibility of self-guided ERP?",OCD,1582061677,nuee-ardente,2,1,True,2020-02-18

I‚Äôm so anxious I‚Äôll catch something while I‚Äôm there.

Don‚Äôt know where the OCD ends and I begin. Some depression/despair/depersonalization triggers,"Lately I‚Äôve been fantasizing a lot about what I would be like if I never got infected with doubter‚Äôs disease. 

My first compulsion was born when I was worried about being sick as a little kid and my mom told me to pray to god and everything would be ok. So I kept praying and praying and praying and praying until this parasite was born. Little did I know my prayers summoned a demon. 

The disease pervades every part of my life. My hobbies, my non existent love life, my self image, my personality, anything. All tainted by OCD. 

I‚Äôve never been an outgoing person or an overly social person and that‚Äôs one of my main insecurities. And lately I‚Äôve been feeling lonely and dying for intimacy so thinking about that led me to these thoughts... It‚Äôs hard to become extroverted and likeable and fun and outgoing when you live so cemented into your own head, thoughts, and doubts about everything around you. Take some normal kid and lock headphones on his head and play a really dark, depressing audiobook or movie audio on repeat all day every day and see what kind of person he or she turns out to be. 

So I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm just a character created by the disease. That‚Äôs really all. It‚Äôs such a strange and sad thing to realize. But I guess everyone is just a character anyway. And the story doesn‚Äôt last long in the grand scheme of the universe and on that level it‚Äôs all gonna end pretty soon.

"One of the biggest traps of OCD is thinking that THIS time you'll solve it, or, JUST five more minutes and you'll be sure for certain","And the reality is that you'll never be sure, because OCD just latches onto the vagueness that can never be proven, and that's what keeps the cycle going. 

I'm talking mostly about rumination/pure o I guess but maybe it applies more broadly too. 

The thing is every time the doubt/anxiety comes around it's my instinctive reaction of discomfort/fear that I want to get rid off. It's not because that the thought/anxiety is true or a real thing of concern, it's that I've learned to react to it as if it's super paramount and critical. 

I just want to get rid of that uncomfortable (sometimes unbearable) anxiety so I think and I ruminate and I perform all these elaborate compulsions because I'm convinced that THIS time it'll work. THIS time I'll find the ultimate answer/solution and the doubt will go away forever. 

**But there is no real solution.** And anything that brings temporary relief only drives the cycle more because the brain has learned through all the attention on it that this is a critical threat that needs to be solved, and it just goes on and on and on and on. 

There's enough false hope, false threat, and most importantly vagueness (aka there will ALWAYS be something that your OCD can latch onto again - like something undefinable like good or bad or love or evil or - ), that it can go on for what feels like forever. 

It's like this bridge between the OCD and logical part of the brain that can never be crossed no matter how much you try, it's like hitting a glass wall. The logical self from a distance KNOWS how irrational and ridiculous this all is but seems to be unable to do a thing. 

A genuine counter intuitive solution that I've found so hard to implement is to accept it. It's utterly unthinkable to accept something as distressing as your doubt or anxiety but that is how it's let go. 

Doubt: ""What if [something I did] resulted in [catastrophic outcome]?"" 

And instead of responding in panic trying to prove to yourself that [x] cannot have caused [y], you just have to learn to go: 

""Okay, maybe that's true. Maybe [something I did] DID result in [catastrophic outcome]. I'm just going to live with that possibility and move on."" Your logical brain is going no wait that can't possibly be true - but it's an infinite trap to try and prove that to your OCD. 

Just accepting it mindfully and distracting yourself, treating the doubt like any other that comes and goes, tells your brain it's **not** a life threatening thing that must be feared and resolved. It, like a lot of things, is simply an irrational, often undefinable thing that isn't actually that catastrophic. 

**And it works.** 

The few times I've tried this and it was successful, it was almost hilariously successful. Without constant vigilance of my anxiety or doubt and immediately trying to fight it, it just....went away. 

Credit where credit is due. A lot of the useful stuff I'm paraphrasing comes from the ideas of Steven Phillipson, who wrote a lot of articles on OCD online. Some of them have, well, not ""cured"" me, but have helped me immensely at times in the past.

How can I tell the difference between an intrusive thought and something that has legitimately bothered me for years? I worried myself into depression I think.,"So most of my intrusive thoughts that I‚Äôve recognized have to do with the nature of reality and my meaning in the world. My first irrational thoughts were about whether I was homosexual or not, even though I was a very confident straight man, everyone used to tell me I dressed gay or was too sensitive or whatever. super irrational stuff too, (am I alive, is this real?) but whaddya gonna do? 

I was diagnosed at 17, I am currently 22. Recently I‚Äôve been feeling more anxious and I got a new, but exciting, writing job that has added a lot of new stress. Well with this job, I am becoming financially independent and so I felt it would be the right time to address something with my mom about how my stepfather used to treat me. (Basically a cycle of ignoring until he had to yell or get onto me, then more ignoring, etc) and I‚Äôve always been very paranoid that I was gonna cause him to come after me again. It has made me isolate myself from my family and given me a real sense of loneliness. Recently he caught me smoking weed and he was pissed, so it kinda pushed me over the edge on top of a few other things at the time. 

I would previously describe my obsessions, very little compulsion, as generally mild to almost non-existent while on medication. However, my therapist office stopped offering psych services around this time last year so I ran out of medicine.  

Well due to the re-emergence of those issues paired with my new job and other stressors, such as my mother‚Äôs ever changing mental health, I‚Äôve landed myself into a pretty dark and scary depression. I can‚Äôt watch tv, listen to podcasts, or even play video games with my friends without feeling like if there is a scary negative thought to have, I have it. Even when I don‚Äôt have a negative thought it feels like my brain is cycling through an empty jukebox looking for a classic hit or top 10 to play.

Now I‚Äôm overly empathetic and I keep asking myself if I was just paranoid for the last decade and now I‚Äôve caused myself a huge problem with my stepdad for no reason. I was planning to move out next month rather impulsively but now I feel like I should get better-ish first. 

Also my 23 birthday is in a month and a half and I can‚Äôt stop obsessing about my age and my place in life, especially living with my parents. Even though I have this exciting opportunity and by all signs things seem like they might get better.

Don‚Äôt feel the need to give reassurance, I see that‚Äôs a no no. I just need to state what I‚Äôm going through to hopefully people who can understand.",OCD,1582064602,secretschmeecret,0,1,True,2020-02-18

"Doctor claims no OCD, just ruminations.","Lurker here,

I am a 25 y/o previously diagnosed with severe OCD, GAD, and a host of other problems. I had been seeing the same neuropsych for over five years until I moved out of state last year and required a new doctor. Given the specialty, getting an appointment with a new neuropsych took a long time, and my other symptoms (psychogenic seizures) took the forefront of the first visit with my new doctor. After reviewing my entire case file and completing a 90 minute psych evaluation, the doctor expressed his concerns about my seizures and almost dismissed my previously diagnosed OCD. He explained that I have ruminations, not likely OCD.

If I understood correctly, POCD is unwanted, intrusive, violent ruminations.

My brain cannot bare the images of unwanted self harm and the areas around me bursting into flames. Also, my brain can't stop those images. 

I called and left a message with medical staff today outlining my ever growing troubles with executive functioning and life demands, but when push comes to shove, how am I going to tell a brand new doctor I can't stop thinking about self harm without getting locked up? I have no intention or desire, it just so happens that my brain wants violent images on repeat. I understood this before as my OCD and still try to manage and cope accordingly.

Having a fucking anxiety attack. Is this something you wouldn‚Äôt want you partner to hide from you?,"Hello everyone. I‚Äôm having a panic attack please help. Today I decided I‚Äôm gonna stop doing compulsions. I have a compulsion of moving away from men when I‚Äôm walking by them or they‚Äôre walking by me. I do this because I don‚Äôt want to arouse them and I don‚Äôt want to do it also because I don‚Äôt want trick myself into thinking I did it to arouse them.

Today I decided I‚Äôm just going to stop moving away from them and walk how I normally would. I did that, and I started getting aroused. I started getting aroused because I was thinking about how they might be getting aroused from me being a little close to them. I noticed how I felt and got upset but ignored it because I told myself they are just thoughts and feelings, and I‚Äôm not walking this way to be close to them and only walking this way because I want to stop doing that compulsion. I‚Äôm not sure why I kept getting aroused but I‚Äôm thinking it might be because I haven‚Äôt walked close to a man in so long (I pray that‚Äôs not why I‚Äôm going to be so upset) or because I‚Äôm a few days away from my period. 

Again I started walking normally. I got aroused again and thought to myself ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad I can do this now this feels good‚Äù and felt happy then when I noticed I thought that and felt happy I felt horrible.

What To Do When You Feel Like You Have No Control,"Hey all, lately it‚Äôs been a bit difficult for me with my OCD and all. I feel like it has a lot to do with my perfectionism as well. My family has been helping me move into a new apartment and the way they care for my things is very different than the way I care for my possessions. So sometimes they handle things in a way that really triggers my OCD and makes me feel like I have no control over the situation and it‚Äôs a terrible feeling. What do you guys do when you experience that?

One example is, my family friend rolled my office desk chair on the asphalt driveway to get to the front door, which means it rolled through dirt and probably wore the nice new wheels down a little. That really pained me. I just cringed and closed my eyes because the damage was already done and by that point I wasn‚Äôt going to yell, ‚ÄúStop! Please pick it up‚Äù because that would‚Äôve sounded strange probably or like controlling or annoying. But it really bothered me. I regret not staying there and just moving the chair myself, but there was no way to avoid it, because I had to go unlock the door and open it since I had the keys... I know there was nothing I could have done, but it still bothers me that I guess the lens through which I perceive the world is SO drastically different from everyone else‚Äôs, that I honestly can‚Äôt expect anyone to live up to the standards of perception that would help them see what would trigger me or make me uncomfortable, because in the end it would be unrealistic. So I guess what I‚Äôm saying is, I don‚Äôt know how to cope with this lack of control I feel in certain situations.

Parents with OCD,"One of my parents probably has OCD which I only found out when I got my own diagnosis. She isn't diagnosed as she refuses to recognize her problems and work on them. This is partly very painful for us as kids, because she is including us in her rituals: She has to check everything in the house in a ritualized way. As she refuses to acknowledge that she has a problem she makes us do it for her. Also she really messes with us by seeking reassurance that we locked the door (e.g. If we were the last to leave the house, she will check in on us until we reassure her, that we locked the door). I can remember ger doing this all my childhood but it got particularly worse over the last years. To me this was and is particularly hard to deal with, as I have OCD myself and her reassurance seeking really messed with my head, so that eventually I stopped trusting myself and taking over her checking behavior (which is just and added layer to my other OCD symptoms). There are some obsessions and compulsions that I copied from her, but I don't want to get into much detail here.

My point is: I grew up thinking that all of this is normal. I've been suffering for the past decade from cumpulsions and terrible intrusive thoughts, convinced that all of that was just the way life is. Luckily I am an adult now and can choose to not let these things control my by working on them in therapy. Still I can't help but be mad at my parent for not taking responsibility. I know that I shouldn't as she is sick herself, and also I love her very much. But somehow I feel she made things a lot worse for me and made me suffer more than I should have. Also it is very hard to make clear to her how I suffer today, as she still refuses to see her behavior as a problem and therefore also tries to convince me again that my behavior and thinking was normal, too.

OCD related nightmares / sleep paralysis,"So yeah, not talking about nightmare/sleep related OCD, but the other way around: having bad dreams, or worse, about things you obsess over.

I do not have diagnosed OCD, but I do have tendencies towards it and a risk of developing it, or my symptoms getting worse. I usually obsess over going crazy or psychotic, but I've recovered a lot atm. However, there is still a certain set of compulsions I do daily.

First of all, I have to check everything when I get home, to make sure no one is in my flat. Shower curtain, underside of my bed, cabinets... I know I'm not going to find anything. Still do it.

Second, I have to make sure the front door is locked before I go to sleep. By making sure, I obviously mean pushing and pulling on it about ten times and touching to lock lightly with my hand. Pull, push, touch the lock. You know the drill.

So this part might be potentially triggering for people who fear sleep paralysis or scary nightmares or the like.

This morning, I saw a dream. One of those dreams that feel like you woke up already. In the dream, I heard a click from the front door. I went to check it, and the door was slightly cracked open. I figured that I didn't close it properly, and pulled the door shut. I went to the bathroom, and noticed the shower curtain was closed. I never keep it like that, so I thought it was weird. I went to open it, and the moment I touched it someone attacked me from the behind.

That is when I woke up. Or so I thought, I was laying in my bed and couldn't move, eyes closed. Except that I heard the sound of some people running, from the direction of my front door, towards my bed. As the sound got really close it faded away, so I knew it wasn't real, but it still gave me a good scare.

I woke up, for real this time, and tried to put on the light. Wouldn't you know it, my desk lamp didn't turn on. Now this was just a nasty coincidence that the bulb decided to burn up just then, so I had to get up and put on the rest of the lights.

A bit of context: I get sleep paralysis very often, but it's usually more mild than you'd expect from the online horror stories. I just wake up, have my eyes closed, and can't move. Then, slowly, I snap out of the paralysis. I still don't like it even though I get no hallucinations, so I elect to sleep on my side, every night. Tonight however, I was paralyzed on my side, and as I said, had a pretty creepy audio hallucination to go with it.

So TL;DR do you have experience with the object of your obsessions and fears appearing in your nightmares, or even in a hypnagogic state like that? If it was ""just a dream"" I'd feel a little better, but first having that kind of a false awakening dream and then sleep paralysis that both had to do with my obsessions was kind of unsettling. Any tips for being able to relax come next nightfall? I'm afraid this'll get to me when I try to sleep, even if I feel okay now.",OCD,1582091683,onlyacucumber,3,1,True,2020-02-19

Paranoid about taking care of my new laptop,"Hi!
So I‚Äôve had OCD my...whole life? It goes in waves, both my parents have it and I‚Äôm on meds to help, and yet it only does so much.

I recently got a new mac a week ago and it‚Äôs so expensive that I‚Äôm just paranoid about it suddenly dying, because my last one did it after 6 months a few years back and I had to fix it so many times. 
I clean it constantly, I open and then close it and then I‚Äôm worried it suddenly will die so I open it again. I accidentally got the screen dirty with some old wipes so I went and rubbed it squeaky clean to fix it, and now I‚Äôm worried I somehow hurt it by rubbing the screen too much. 
I got a shell case but then freaked the shell case would damage it and then took it off.
I thought I had beaten OCD for the most part but this is pretty classic signs and I just, I don‚Äôt know what to do. Part of this is that I‚Äôm in college and had my mom help me go to the store and whatnot and I just don‚Äôt want to have to go back for any reason and drag her along. I also am just paranoid I‚Äôll have to spend more money on it. 

Honestly I feel better even typing this out.

Any OCD:ers who study or tried to study?,"Any OCD:ers who study or tried to study?

I got bad OCD during my studies and my take on it has been a bit paradoxical. It has clearly made me lag in progress, because I've found that I haven't had the energy to keep up with required pace, but rather have found that my brain can manage maybe up to 50% of normal workload without seriously overworking it. And even with this it would mean having to ""work full-day"". The drop is possibly related to OCD causing noticeable difficulty in concentration, planning, memory functioning, ...

On the other hand I've found that OCD can ""weirdly"" stimulate creativity. Even when concentration etc. can be troublesome, it can offer ""creative intuition"" on some occasion. Yet I'm not sure if this kind of benefit compensates for the losses of OCD.

"Instead of training my brain to stop finding certain things contaminated, I'm going to train my brain to get rid of the idea that anything can be contaminated","I have COCD, but not about germs. I get worried about being contaminated by evil. In the recent past, my ERP exercises have been around exposing myself to ""contaminated"" things, and waiting for the obsessions to stop telling me those things are contaminated. It's been working, slowly, and it's helped me make some progress. 

But now I have a new idea for an approach, and that is to never respond to the thought that I need to wash when contaminated by evil. I want to exterminate the idea in my mind that you can wash away evil, and eventually the idea that you can be physically contaminated by evil at all. 

Im doing this now, because so far, I have been unwitttedly confirming to my OCD that one *can* wash away evil, just some things I thought needed to be washed away, in fact did not. By exposing myself to certain words or objects only, my mind finds those things not contaminated, but keeps the paradigm that contamination for *other* things is still possible. If I can kill the obsession that you can wash away evil in the first place, then I will be addressing the real obsession, and the real problem. 

The last few days I've made a little progress on this front. I havent done my special evil decontamination handwash yet. This ritual is more complex than my normal cleaning up hand washing routine. This has made my generic handwash ritual feel less powerful too, though I still occasionally wash my hands with my generic hand wash when I feel exposed to evil. However, I have not washed my hands in response to words, thoughts, and other triggers most of the time. I can already tell it's getting easier. I think this is the right approach. 

I write things like this here, because writing it in general feels like ERP, but writing in public is another layer of ERP. I am here to WIN!!!! 

Also, I thought maybe others could benefit from reading about my process and how I design and execute ERP on my own. I have over a decade of training in ERP, and know what I am doing.

Your OCD is stone cold evidence that you CARE,"Goign through a real bad patch at the moment, having a lot of panic atatcks etc. but just read something that helped me a little...

OCD is the fear network in the brain telling us we need to take action IMMEDIETELY. OCD is the fear network of the brain sending a signal that something is wrong and needs to be done about it IMMEDIATELY. 

OCD only reports on feared consequences that are important to a person. For example, if somebody does not fear spilling water on the floor, OCD will not send the intrusive thought, ‚ÄúOh no you spilled water. You must clean it up IMMEDIATELY‚Äù. 

On the other hand if someone does care about the safety of her family, OCD might say, ‚ÄúOh no you left the stove on. You must go back and check IMMEDIATELY or the most important people in your life will die and it will be all your fault.‚Äù 

Similarly, if you care deeply about your family's well-being or your students safety, OCD may inject itself into your awareness with the thought ‚ÄúOh no. What if I lose control and harm my children or students.‚Äù

By having these intrusive thoughts it really just proves that you deeply care and the OCD is just the fear network in your brain projecting itself as a 'WHAT IF'. The OCD has no power over your actions, you will always have control even though it definately DOES NOT feel like it most of the time.

So when I was between 18 and 20, me and my partner were sleeping. I was really horny so I was masturbating next to him while he slept, which I now would not do. I can't remember but I think I tried to wake him up so we could have sex by touching him and trying to get him 'interested'. But the thing that i'm worried about is that i'm not sure if I tried to get him off in his sleep or not. There's no way I can find this out, either. Additionally, I can't even remember when it was, because it was around 4 - 6 years ago, and in that time, we had sex a lot. 

My brain says to forget about it, since i now understand consent a lot better and think that was a stupid thing to do. Sometime during the relationship, he also expressed that he wanted me to give him oral sex in his sleep to wake him up.  I would never do this again (if I did in fact do it) since I understand relationships and consent a lot more now, and know communication is key. I was just a young idiot at the time. I've learnt a valuable lesson through worrying about this.

If I can't be certain about what happened, I can't be certain whether or not I assaulted him by touching him when he was asleep. We also broke up last year so I can't really reach out and ask if he'd be upset if I had done that. There's just no way for me to gain certainty, and I know wanting certainty is my OCD. I also feel the strong need to admit this to him, he already knows the masturbation part.

But how can I continue in other relationships etc. if I don't know what happened?",OCD,1582122954,throwaway2232333099,1,1,True,2020-02-19
"Why does the mind revisit obsessions that bothered me years ago, but I thought were not an issue for me anymore?","Apologies if that has been asked before. The last 2 months have been awful as I have been tormented by old obsessions that bothered me maybe 5 years ago. I thought that I was through the worst of it with my most recent obsession and had reached some career milestones, albeit burnt out. I even managed to quit drinking 2 months ago (still sober!) Then BAM! My old obsession hit me up and has left me feeling incapacitated.

I had attributed much of my recovery to seeking out some limited therapy sessions, and Lexapro - which had been a huge help for the last 3 years. Although I've recently been diagnosed with ADHD and was taking Strattera. To make matters worse, I had presented with patterns of binge drinking for the last 2 years, but had noticed this being a bad habit which prompted me to quit.

So an old obsession has triggered my OCD symptoms to come back full force, I feel like my lexapro doesn't work anymore - was prescribed Ativan for occasional use, but it made me feel weird and I'd like to not use benzos, and this is happening during my last semester of grad school. :(

Does anyone know what this could even be (long post sorry),"Im not sure if this is due to my OCD or literally a brain injury 



Im diagnosed with bpd, gad and ocd. I also have had traumatic events in my life, that I repressed the memories of for YEARS. 
In April-July of 2019, I got hit in the head, jaw, spine and face multiple times. I play rep travel softball, and girls can hit and throw HARD, and its overall pretty intense, even during practise. 
I got 2 overhand thrown balls to the head, a bat full swung to the back of my head n one to the top of my spine, a full pitch to my jaw, I slide into home and got trampled by the catcher who fell onto my head, and went head first into the pole on the metal fence, etc.... I rlly didn‚Äôt think anything of it because at the moment it didn‚Äôt bother me or hurt too bad, which was the stupidest thing I‚Äôve done ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 
Since around the end of July my mental health issues have gotten MUCH worse and I‚Äôve even experienced dpdr or something similar. I also smoked consistently during this time and even had weed laced with fentanyl n pcp (I think ü§≠). 
Before this all happened, id have episodes of dissociation normally from extreme anxiety and my  now diagnosed bpd, but its taken a turn for the worst 
In July my first noticeable episode (apart from the laced weed ep) I had tunnel vision for days, thought I was dead, heart palpitation, etc.... this time was much much much worse than any episode I‚Äôve ever had before. Until November I didn‚Äôt have any other episodes, but my ocd was extremely severe and almost debilitating. Then in NovemberI had a panic attack and it lead me into a crazy dissociation episode, with dpdr symptoms. It went away after just over a month and I was perfectly fine, but my ocd was over the roof severe, from December till a few days ago. A few days ago it happened again, I had a huge and intense argument with my parents, which led me to freak tf out, and again I went into this weird and uncomfortable dissociation state, which I‚Äôm still in right now, the same feeling as I was in November. But the really weird thing is, is that I don‚Äôt remember ANYTHING of the episode in November, I just remember the day it happened and the day is dissipated, I have very faint memories of that episode. I do completely remember from December- till like 4 days ago when it happened again, and before it happen in November, but not during it. But I do know it feels the exact same way. Im just not sure what it even is, I was wondering if anyone had ANY sort of clue. Ill put my all my symptoms down: 

Mental symptoms: 
- constant deja-vu, like literally every 10 mins or less 
- constant nostalgia feeling 
- jamais-vu 
- not connected to memories 
- flashbacks of all repressed memories constantly, 24/7 
- cant remember any dreams and feels like I didn‚Äôt   sleep 
- blank mind feelings, no thoughts, loss of inner  monologue sometimes, unless I force it, etc.... about that topic 
- cant concentrate or focus on literally anything 
- ocd/pure O loop of memories, feels like I‚Äôm stuck in them or re-living them if that make any sense lmao 
- feels like I‚Äôm dead or that I‚Äôm in a dream 
- short-term memory loss sometimes 
- nothing I do feels like I‚Äôm doing it, even though I am 
- cant recognize my friends or family I‚Äôm certain moments, even though I KNOW who they are 
- even worse procrastination problems 
- no feelings or emotions when this happens (which is weird because My emotions are over the top because of bpd), the only feeling is fear or extreme anxiety 
- ocd and bpd symptoms go away, ocd just becomes mental loops 
- feels like I‚Äôm literally going crazy, even though I know I‚Äôm not 
- detached from body and mind 
- too self aware or no self-awareness whatsoever 
- Im an extrovert and I‚Äôm usually the one friend who makes everyone more lighthearted, but with this I‚Äôm  completely quiet and blank out even more talking to people 
- cant plan or think of anything most if the time, cause of memory loop at time ^^ blank mind 
- apathy to the extreme 
- constant fight or flight mode 
- cant remember what I was thinking from a minute  ago sometimes, my thoughts just race away and I cant remember them, which is unusual for me unless in this state 
- what I JUST did doesn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôve ever done it, and that its in a dream 
- an impending doom feeling when getting extreme   deja-vu or flashbacks of repressed memories 
- psychosis symptoms 
- no connection to anyone, cant connect to people that I usually can 
- feels like I‚Äôve gone back in time and other fears becoming debilitating (ocd) 

Physical: 
- tunnel vision 
- everything‚Äôs blurry or wayyyy to clear 
- lights and sounds are amplified and hurts my ears and eyes 
- constantly tired and lethargic 
- doesn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôve slept when I‚Äôve slept 
- head pressure and constant headache that doesn‚Äôt  go away with medication 
- hot and cold flashes 
- rising doom feeling, that someone has a gun to my head 
- heart palpitations and horrible chest pain 
- nauseous all day and vomiting 
- cramps 
- visual snow 
- disoriented and confused constantly 
- cant walk properly, wobbling 

Then it goes away after a few weeks and I go completely back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. My regular ocd, gad and bpd comes back, none of those things bothers me, I cant think clearly and properly again, those memories don‚Äôt scare me or even come up anymore, I feel connected to myself and back to me again, etc.... 
I find this really weird, but lastly I have a small seizure (I think) before these episodes happen, from the extreme stress. Ill feel nauseous and have to sit down, then ill seize up and shake for like 45 seconds, and ill have even worse deja-vu and flashbacks then usual, ill be fine after for a few hours, then I go into these episodes. 
Just wondering if anyone has any clue what this is, I‚Äôm  scared it might be head trauma or some scary mental problem caused by it.",OCD,1582128827,Think-Mastodon,1,1,True,2020-02-19
OCD is one horrible mental health disorder and how i overcome it (hear me out),"I hate this disorder, it made my life super hard, and after months and months, I finally discovered why I wasn't productive in my life, it's because of OCD, I spend 80% of my time washing my hands, trying to debate this ""Bully"" in mind over stupid and when I say stupid I mean STUPID thoughts..., and if there is one thing you should learn about OCD is that it's a doubting disease, and that's the worst part, to be honest.

BUT I have some good news for you, my dear friends, you should know that dozens of studies from the 1980s to the present suggest the mind (brain) remains plastic throughout life and can be modified.

 dozens of studies from various researchers ranging from experiments on animals to working with stroke victims in patients suffering from dyslexia suggest that the brain is plastic and it can be remapped and changed with mental effort.

 so hear me out WE ARE NOT SLAVES TO GENETICS OR BRAIN CHEMISTRY but actively able to change it through willpower and effort, this is most obvious in the works of a neuroscientist named Jeffrey Schwartz who published studies working with OCD patients and demonstrated how mental effort can rewire brain chemistry, from brain scans  Schwartz found that certain parts of the brain displayed abnormal activity... however he would then have his OCD patients  engage in intense mental effort in focusing through what he labeled as : 

1-relabeling 

2-reattributing 

3-refocusing 

4-revaluing

so he found that patients who went through his mental focusing therapy experienced considerable relief from their OCD symptoms, but also their brain scans indicated a realignment of the abnormal brain activity without any external intervention, OCD patients we're directly able to reorganize in change their brain patterns by intentionally modifying their behavior and thoughts.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

so how did I overcome this horrible disorder? before I tell you, you noticed that I said ""willpower and effort"", so you should be strong and patient, here is the secret:

DON'T LISTEN TO YOUR OCD THOUGHTS 

DON'T FOCUS ON YOUR OCD THOUGHTS AND IGNORE THEM because remember they don't mean anything and don't reflect who you are, your brain then dismiss them, your anxiety will rise for sure, but remember, we can only change our brain patterns by "" willpower and effort""

so when my ""Bully"" said wash your hands more, I simply ignored ""him"" and I didn't give the thoughts any energy.

so what should you take away from this: we are not slaves to our genetics and we can heal ourselves with mental effort and mindfulness.

Recently I‚Äôve been suffering from OCD and intrusive thoughts (about a week). At first the intrusive thoughts were terrible and I was panicking, but the last few days all I‚Äôve been doing is researching OCD and intrusive thoughts to try and reassure myself that I‚Äôm not crazy and These things happen to a lot of people. My mind has somewhat accepted that these thoughts aren‚Äôt necessarily mine but my OCD and brain bringing some of my worst fears to the surface. For some reason though I can not shake the thoughts. I try to continue what I‚Äôm doing or just let the thoughts pass but they always seem to come back. I can be sitting there having a great time and my brain says ‚Äúhey it‚Äôs been a while since you thought about so and so‚Äù and the cycle continues. I just wanna be able to live freely away from these horrible thoughts.

I set up a session with a therapist I used to see about a year ago but the most recent appointment I can get is a month away and I have a huge trip coming up that I‚Äôd rather not have ruined by these irrational and horrible thoughts.

Which makes me feel like I need to look for something new. I know this stems back to childhood trauma from the recession and as well as poor parents with bad addiction habits, which obviously creates a lot of insecurities and needs for reassurance. 

What is really the kicker and most annoying thing on this, is I know I am a high performer at work and in a high demand field, I‚Äôm just always searching for what will be my ending at my job even though it might not exist.

Schiz OCD,"Hey guys,

I just need a place to vent. I'm absolutely terrified of developing schizophrenia. My obsession started about 6-7 seven months ago, and I cannot shake it. I took a Prometheus genetics test that said that I have a higher than average chance of developing the disease, even though I do not have anyone in the family who has had it. My compulsions started out as doing a TON of research and becoming hyperaware of every sound and checking with other people to make sure that they heard what I was hearing. I then started to hear whispers in my fans (crazy I know) and hear my name in everyday sounds when it got really bad. If I got really anxious and focused I could hear what I was thinking repeat in the fan through a whisper but then I could stop hearing it if I wanted too. During this time, I started seeing a psychiatrist and he assured me that I was not schizophrenic and that usually negative symptoms are the first symptoms present (thankfully I do not have depression or anything related to the negative symptoms). My regular therapist also told me that I am not schizophrenic and just have bad anxiety and OCD. I see my therapist every week and my psychiatrist every month, although he has been on medical leave for the past few months which has contributed to my current anxiety. I also have fleeting thoughts of paranoia that started after I became concerned I had schizophrenia, such as what if my partner is cheating on me? I also had a bizarre thought for a split second when I was listening to music and it was ""what if this girl is talking about my boyfriend in her song?"" I then got jealous for a fraction of a second and then got overwhelmingly anxious that I got jealous because that must mean that I am developing a psychotic disorder. I used to have a sticky note over my camera on my laptop (I watch stuff in my bathtub) but took it off once I read that people with schizophrenia are concerned that the government is spying on them.  I am so scared that this is something more nefarious than my OCD, especially due to the whispers. They are only present when I am not doing anything and there is white noise in the background-usually some time of fan. I can tune them out if I want too I think.  I am also struggling with word retrieval, reading comprehension, and noticed in one of my recent pictures that my eyes looked a little vacant. 

I should mention, every time I get anxious I have to research schizophrenia and get reassurance from my family. I am constantly telling my parents and SO all of my symptoms in case I have a psychotic break so they can accurately inform the doctors. 

I am doing well in my relationships, I am getting really good grades in my graduate school, I have friends, I have a part-time job, and I am showing no other symptoms besides still hearing whispers in white noises and occasionally still having a fleeting thought of paranoia. I suppose I should also mention I have pretty bad tinnitus. Don't you think if I was actually developing schizophrenia that would be a decline in other areas of my life? 

I will say I have had this situation happen to me before where I think I have a serious illness, develop the symptoms, and then find out through a test (such as D-dimer blood test, MRI, etc.) that I do not have the illness and move on to another one. The problem with schizophrenia is that there is no single test that can disprove I have it :( Sorry if my post was disorganized!

QUACK THERAPISTS‚ÄîI‚Äôm so angry,"Wow. So I moved to a new city for college and in this whole midsized city, I haven‚Äôt been able to find a single therapist who‚Äôs ERP certified/trained. 

My insurance called in network providers for me and not a single one was trained. However this is my problem: they all said that ‚ÄúERP doesn‚Äôt work‚Äù or that ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt believe in it‚Äù which makes me so mad. When I called to ask what they believed did work, they all hemmed and hawed, and no one could give me a clear answer on what they would do instead. 

I‚Äôm so angry because I feel like just because they don‚Äôt understand ERP/CBT/OCD they snub ERP treatment. I had a therapist who didn‚Äôt know how to do ERP but claimed to still treat OCD. She was shit. She didn‚Äôt understand intrusive thoughts, or compulsions or rituals or obsessions. 

I guess I just needed to vent to people who understand. I think that OCD requires more targeted treatment than general anxiety or depression, because you need to fix the faulty alarm systems in your brain that make everything feel so high stakes. I‚Äôm flabbergasted that there are therapists who are acting so cavalier about OCD treatment, and who couldn‚Äôt give me a straight answer when I asked how they‚Äôd treat it.

Real event OCD / Quitting drinking after rock bottom driving incident / How to forgive myself,"Hi, everyone -- I was wondering if I could get some advice support here. I have decided, after years of abusing alcohol that I am going to finally stop drinking for good. It's the only way that I can see how to end the self-destruction that's been plaguing me for years. 

Long story short - my wife and I are having marital problems over my OCD and it's been a real challenge to not drink the pain away for the last month or so. Two nights ago, after having not eaten all day, I drank 10 beers. I'm 195 pounds, but I'm still a ""light weight"" and that mixed with not eating, made me feel completely obliterated drunk. I started drinking at around 8:00 that night and didn't stop until 12:30. 

I went to work the next morning at around 11:30am. I didn't feel drunk when I left the house. I was lost in thought, perhaps maybe still impaired by the alcohol and nearly killed a man by merging into his lane and almost causing him to hit a wall.

Can Buspar work for OCD? I'm really scared to get back on an SSRI.,"I was recently diagnosed with OCD after totally believing for at least 7 years %100 that what I was experiencing was just an intense general anxiety disorder. I got off of SSRI's and antidepressants about 4 months ago because I felt I had beaten depression and I was tired of relying on antidepressants. WELL. My anxiety came back FULL F\*CKING FORCE. But with it came looped/repetitive/obsessive fears that I just chocked up to the anxiety and insecurity issues (for my situation, it seemed to make sense).   
Well, OCD is a b\*tch is and I am really struggling. I am TERRIFIED of becoming depressed again due to the way I think it will impact a certain obsessive fear that I have been battling. But I really really really don't want to go on an SSRI again. I like my sex life with my partner too much, and I have another fear that the SSRI will change me into someone he won't want anymore.  
I am currently on Buspar (Buspirone). I've been told that Buspar is an anxiety-only medicine. Only an SSRI will be effective with the repetitive fear loops of OCD, which is my biggest mental struggle right now. Is this true? Does anyone have experience with Buspar? Should I bite the incredibly uncomfortable bullet and get back on a medication that might bring back depression and numb me out? I really don't know what to do and I can't seem to make a decision.

"Consent OCD and not sure if I‚Äôm in the wrong :( (NSFW, triggering)","Hello all,

I have suffered major OCD over the years, most of my obsessions involve sex, sexual assault and being accused of crimes.  I attribute this to being sexually abused as a child by a relative.

A while back I had sex with a girl while both of us were drunk and had smoked marijuana.  She sobered up a lot more as we got up back to her place, but at that point I was very tired so I was planning on just sleeping there without doing anything.  She got up and said ‚ÄúI never sleep with clothes on‚Äù or something and took off her clothes.  She then laid next to me and initiated me giving her oral sex.  She also grabbed my privates and said something to the effect of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt come inside me‚Äù and the sex lasted short time because I was too tired.  We never said ‚Äúyes let‚Äôs have sex‚Äù 

With all of the me too stuff out I‚Äôm worried because we both didn‚Äôt express consent and because we were both drunk that I‚Äôm some sort of monster, that part of me took advantage of her.  We lost contact and she unfollowed me on Instagram but I still follow her, so of course I took this as a sign that I did something wrong.  can someone just tell me if I‚Äôm a monster or not? The last thing I‚Äôd want to do as someone who was sexually assault would be to sexually assault someone.  It‚Äôs just scary cause I read stuff like never to have sex drunk and that men are evil and whatnot and I‚Äôm worried that I‚Äôm like some lunatic who takes advantage of people.

HOCD or denial?,"Let me start by explaining my childhood. I developed my first crushes in first grade, when I had a strong admiration for the female body. I remember seeing pictures of hot women and being aroused. Fast forward to seventh and eighth grade when I was in middle school athletics, I would take showers in the same shower as other men and remember no feelings at all of sexual arousal. If anything, I thought it was disgusting to be in the same shower as other naked guys. I was able to notice if other men were attractive back then, but again did not get any sort of arousal or desire to see men in minimal clothes like I did with women.At the start of 9th grade I got really interested with women. I would watch youtube videos of women in just bras, and began to watch porn at around that time. I was really intrigued by it. However, around 10th-11th grade is when my problems began. I began to notice that my mouth would water if I thought of the features of other guys; nothing else would happen. No erection, nothing, just watery mouth. I wondered if this meant I had a sexual desire to be with guys, then I worried I might be gay. It stayed like this for a while, the fact that my mouth would water at any thought of a guy would bother me, but it did not completely convince me that I was homosexual.

However, as time went on, other things began to happen. I began to notice other signs that I might be gay when I thought of guys. I was never fully erect, but would notice a slight erection if I thought too hard about sexual interactions with other men. I began to get really worried and this is when the worst part of my experiences happened. From morning to night I would think about my sexual orientation. I would put thoughts in my head of both men and women to check for arousal. I began to get worried when my arousal for women diminished and I noticed an existent arousal for men. I must say, I am still attracted to women, yet not as much as I once was. I find it harder to develop an erection for women now compared to my 9th and 10th grade days.

Now I am in 12th grade and am very scared. It has gone as bad as worrying about precum at the thought of guys. I would hate myself when I would see a shirtless guy while browsing instagram and instantly start to worry and think thoughts like ""Don't react"" or ""If you find him attractive you're gay."" Sure enough, at these thoughts, my reaction would only get worse. Reactions went from a slight erection to potential precum (I don't know if it was precum or piss leaking?? Idk how to describe it, but that's what worried me even more). I also commit in constant checking of whether or not I am erect, if I precame, etc.

The issue takes over every minute of my life. I worry to commit to a relationship with a woman because of fear that I wouldn't be comfortable in it. I feel like my thoughts are taking control of my life and need help. I don't know if I have HOCD or if I am just gay/bi and not willing to accept it because I live in a Christian household.

Weird Form of OCD? Need some advice please.,"I've been playing tennis for the past few years and have improved a lot, playing almost every day and really dedicating my time obsessively to playing. I say obsessive because I was super hard on myself about training as much as I could and would obsess if I played badly, etc. Anyways, I was really happy to reach my goal of making a college team, which was my ultimate goal. Because I started playing tennis so late, I still haven't caught up with the other players on the team and the skill most people are at my age, however I'm definitely a good player. This frustrates me because I always feel like I'm ""catching up"" and never really give my self credit for the work I've put in.

Onto the OCD part, it is currently the offseason for college tennis so I haven't been playing much, which has been a weird adjustment because I really haven't gone more than a few days without playing in the past year and a half. Ive been and been really hard on myself about not playing, and can't seem to relax because of it. Now Im thinking about if I really enjoy the sport because I imagine myself playing and for some reason I'm getting a dissatisfied/bad feeling when I do so? I'm constantly checking myself to see if I get that feeling now. Ive been playing a couple times a week, but in general not much practice. This has been gnawing at me for the past week. I don't know if I'm just unmotivated to play the sport right now, or just stopped liking it. When I think of the fact that I don't like tennis anymore I get really anxious because I have worked so hard to get to this point and I feel like a failure if I don't like the sport.

I've had past experiences with OCD, my most recent was HOCD(homosexual OCD) which if you don't know what it is look it up. I did some exposure therapy but what helped most was just distracting myself and I don't feel affected by those thoughts anymore. These thoughts I'm getting about tennis give me the same vibe I got from HOCD, which makes me think its a form of OCD(I hope it is, because I want to keep playing tennis(that reminds me of what I would say when I was dealing with HOCD)). Anyways, I'm not looking for reassurance but if anyone has had a type of OCD when they're constantly arguing if they like something or not, let me know. I'll probably talk to a therapist about this.

Currently sitting outside and unable to go back in,"Last month, my wife and I had vermiculite insulation professionally removed from our attic.

Recent OCD spike after long period of resisting compulsions,"Hi all,

I‚Äôve been following this subreddit for years, have not engaged very much. 

I am a 25 y/o male and I have been living with OCD since around the age of 8/9.  It began with mindless repetition/ritualizing (I‚Äôd read every word of a page twice, have to touch objects x # of times, etc.).  

It has evolved over the years, but became much more manageable and nearly non-existent through high school.  I haven‚Äôt been to much therapy, probably a cumulative 5/6 months over the years.  I found distractions to be the most effective way of dealing with it.  

Today, however, out of nowhere, I felt ridiculously strong compulsions that I even caught myself being distracted over at work (something that hasn‚Äôt happened in years).  I‚Äôm feeling scared and discouraged, which only makes me more susceptible to new compulsions.

Intrusive thoughts about past sexual abuse that never happened?,"My OCD these past few months has settled on a new obsession and it's tearing me apart. Back in November, after smoking marijuana, I was plagued with ""memories"" that I was raped/sexually abused in my past. Now, the thing is, I never was. I can say with full confidence and certainty that I was never sexually abused by anyone in my life. I was emotionally and physically abused, but not sexually. The thoughts or ""memories"" have yet to let up, even after removing weed from my life and stopping Seroquel (a major catalyst in my OCD symptoms getting worse). I've grown afraid of my own dad as he's the focal point of these intrusive thoughts. I don't understand why my brain chose him when he's literally never done anything to hurt me and I love him more than anything in the world, but it's just getting exhaaaauuuusting at this point. I can't even hear someone say ""dad"" or it'll set me off. Has anyone else struggled with this type of thing? How can I cope and heal while learning to love my dad again? I'm in CBT and on medications, but even so, those little *what if it's real* slip through the cracks and really make me question or doubt everything I know to be fact.",OCD,1582165857,dylanjpierce,2,1,True,2020-02-19

Finding the humor is important,"I‚Äôve started a new ERP technique under my therapist‚Äôs watch where I try to turn a lot of my obsessions and fears into jokes to try and take some of the heavy weight off.

I have a girlfriend whom I adore dearly. We have a perfectly matching sense of humor‚Äîwe‚Äôre both big goofballs who laugh about anything and everything, especially if it‚Äôs absurd. 

I was talking to her excitedly about how my father and I had made plans this summer to renovate one of our farm‚Äôs old corn cribs at risk of collapsing into a small study space/camping place for me. Just a little room with electricity powered by running water and a desk and a blow up mattress‚Äînothing super fancy, but a place I can get away to relax in nature and spend some time out of the city, which is important to me. I offhandedly joked about just becoming a hermit and living off of trout and mushrooms and studying forbidden knowledge in my small hut with a big cloak, and thus the little place was dubbed ‚Äúthe Hermit Hut‚Äù. I thought this was funny and sent a long and rambling Snapchat video to my girlfriend about it, but immediately after she watched it but there wasn‚Äôt a response, I got that familiar ol‚Äô OCD fear about my girlfriend thinking I‚Äôm weird or cringey for being excited about my Hermit Hut (unlikely).

How to differenciate ¬´ normal ¬ª thoughts from thoughts caused by OCD?,"Hi! I have recently been diagnosed with OCD. My main obsession is about my sexual orientation.

My psychologist says I definitely don‚Äôt have BPD but I‚Äôm not convinced. I think about this a few times a day, but it doesn‚Äôt cause me as much distress as my doubts around my sexual orientation. Does this mean that this is just a normal thought? 

Ever since my psychologist told me that my doubts surrounding my sexual orientation are caused by OCD, I have been analyzing my thought process and my life to find signs of OCD. I don‚Äôt know what is normal or not anymore. I feel like a liar and that in a few years I‚Äôll have to tell my family and friends that I don‚Äôt actually have OCD and that it‚Äôs something else, like BPD or that I‚Äôm just attention seeking.

Psychotic symptoms without being diagnosed as psychotic,"So, had OCD for over 6 years now, took zoloft, for that time, however I noticed that sometimes when I am more stressed (and hence have more obsessions) than usual, I have some quasi, or pseudo hallucinations, in the sense I kind of know they aren't real.
For instance, in a situation of heightened anxiety, I will start smelling smells that aren't there, or have tactile feelings, like feeling a rain drop indoors or feeling cold wind blowing on my limbs while indoors as well.

Violent thoughts when connecting with family or friends.,"I‚Äôve always had a hard time connecting with people but it seems like whenever I do, I get extremely violent thoughts towards those people. It gives me a lot of anxiety. I‚Äôve read this could be a form of OCD?? Can anyone relate?

No I‚Äôm not a monster nor have I ever hurt anyone. I‚Äôm probably one of the most sensitive and empathetic people you will meet :) Blood on TV makes me cringe although I love watching Forensic Files and murder mysteries.

I am in the midst of quitting a couple different substances. Kratom and Phenibut. They seem to make the thoughts worse. I also get these thoughts when I‚Äôm 100% sober for long periods of time.

i haven‚Äôt been leaving the house very often (depression, intrusive thoughts,...) but last saturday my friends convinced me to go to a house show they were playing at. at that show a girl overdosed and had to be taken to the hospital. i later found out that she was 12. i saw a glimpse of her before the ambulance came and its one of the more disturbing things i‚Äôve ever seen, i haven‚Äôt been able to get the image out of my head. i have no way of knowing if shes ok. 

yesterday was the second time i‚Äôve left my house since that, i went over to my friends house because i‚Äôve been feeling extremely isolated and stir crazy. after about an hour of hanging out, we went into the kitchen and found their roommates cat, hanging off of a table cloth by its claws and completely stiff. she was dead. she had no prior health problems and was acting completely fine just half an hour before (she was really old though). it was extremely disturbing and i had to go home after that. 

i‚Äôm terrified that somehow this is my doing, but i also recognize that thats impossible and irrational. i don‚Äôt want this to lead to more isolation, but this fear won‚Äôt go away. idk i‚Äôm going to therapy soon so this is definitely something i should bring up. god i hate my brain so much.",OCD,1582217472,kingmorpheuss,2,1,True,2020-02-20

Struggling,"I'll begin this post by providing some much needed context. I lived a highly traumatic childhood. Constantly getting beat up by radically conservative parents who saw me crying and wanted me to ""behave like the boy they raised"" and ""not like a sissy"". I'm trans and have known since forever but I struggled to come out due to childhood experience dealing with school and family bullies. Add my Asperger's diagnosis to the table and you begin to see the full picture of the hell I've been through.

That being said, I was forced to return to the house where I grew up in after a mental breakdown led to my dropping out of college. Since I came back, it has only gotten worse. This is the house where all of the trauma I suffered from took place. Since I came back, my OCD symptoms have only worsened and I am not functional anymore. I take hours to go to bed and find myself constantly checking things and washing my hands late at night. Not sure if this makes any sense. I've spent endless amount of time looking for people with similar stories to see if returning to the source of the trauma could trigger such a response but I haven't really found anything significant.

"How do you overcome OCD surrounding a real, serious mistake?","I had an online affair (flirting with another man). The shame and guilt of it eats me alive everyday. 

I confessed to my partner because it was the honest thing to do - he forgave me, which I certainly don't deserve.

I've had previous bouts of OCD in the past (mostly self-harm) but the real-event OCD has struck with a **vengeance**, to the point where I considered ending my life. I'm not going to, because that would hurt my partner more than the cheating.

I am obsessed with confessing every past transgression, whether it's real or not. Everything possible I think might upset my partner. I worry if I don't tell him this one little thing, then this will be the thing that comes back to haunt me and we'll break up. I also have to get his opinion on every sort of cheating scenario there is, from physical to sexting, etc. I'm always worried I'll remember some other little comment I said that I'll need to urgently confess.

It's ruining my relationship and I feel awful for making my long-suffering partner feel worse. If I can't help myself soon, I feel I'll have to break up with him so he doesn't have to suffer anymore.

Recently diagnosed with health anxiety + OCD and confused,"Hi, this is my first time posting here. I hope I'm not accidentally triggering someone.

I was recently diagnosed with illness anxiety disorder plus obsessive-compulsive disorder (partial insight) by a psychiatrist. Honestly, I'm very confused.

At first, I believed my problem was contamination OCD. I had read a lot about it. Although I also suspected there could be some health anxiety issues involved. The main reasons I wanted it to be OCD instead of health anxiety were that I think there's more research about it and treatment is highly successful. Also, I rarely worry about minor symptoms or check my body for signs of illness. This could be because I'm mostly worried about asymptomatic diseases which can only be detected by medical tests. I thought my main diagnosis would be OCD. I have a fear that every object can be contaminated with viruses or bacteria, and I feel like I absolutely have to wash my hands or apply hand sanitizer after I touch things. I thought my compulsion was getting many lab tests done which ease the anxiety a little, anxiety that comes back after a while or a new ""risky event"". I'm extremely worried about infecting the people I love too. But OCD people have insight, and they know their obsessions are irrational. I'm not quite sure I think my fears are absurd. Most of the time I feel like I'm already infected and I'm unable to believe I'm healthy, especially when I'm stressed out. But I'm also very afraid of somehow catching a new disease. I was very confused when the psychiatrist asked if I was anxious because I thought without a doubt that I had a disease or because I was scared of the possibility of catching one. They don't sound that different to me. I was also very confused when he asked if these intrusive thoughts come out of nowhere and how much time in a day these obsessions and compulsions take. I feel like I'm just constantly thinking about this and can only forget about it for a few minutes when I'm truly immersed in something. It doesn't help that I'm introverted and have huge trouble speaking my mind and opening up to others. Maybe I'm not making any sense?

Getting both diagnosis was kind of disturbing, even more so that illness anxiety disorder was the main one. Well, I'm not sure about this, but the doctor wrote that one first. I'm feeling very sad and hopeless. I don't know if treatment will work for me. I'm afraid I won't be able to have peace of mind ever again. I'm afraid I will always believe I have a very serious disease and nobody can convince me otherwise. I'm afraid I will always believe there's a very dangerous and contaminated world out there.

I guess I just wanted to know, is there hope for me? Do other people here have both disorders? I don't know if that's common? Has treatment worked? Is there a good book I can read about illness anxiety disorder? I know there's a few ones about OCD and I'm planning on reading those too. I was put on an antidepressant (took my first pill today) and a benzo. Doctor said the benzo thing is temporary but I'm scared of becoming addicted. I just can't win :(

just got diagnosed + some questions about CBT,"hello everyone!
I recently got diagnosed with severe ocd of the dermatillomania and dermatophagia type (lovely, isn't it?) around the end of january and will have my first CBT session on the 24th, though it's group CBT as I get very uncomfortable to have 1 on 1 anything, like appointment with my GP, it just makes me feel claustrophobic.

My mum took my diagnoses really weirdly, the therapy was ok until she saw what group therapy could entail (nature walks etc.) and she chastised me because I'd only go outside if someone from the nhs said I should, and not if she told me to. (That totally felt amazing to be invalidated.) Then I told her about my depression and she said I didn't look depressed and act like a zombie. (Loved that part because she said she was also depressed when I was younger, so I thought she'd have more sympathy but whatever, I'm only your child right?) I brought up medication, she got very heated and started saying how I'll get addicted and won't be able to focus on my exams. Argh! And now sometimes I get why my brothers wanted to move out so damn much. 

My brother was an angel about it, really, he was very supportive about therapy and medication. So at least one of my siblings and family members is normal.

Anyway, sorry to ramble and vent a little. I wanted to ask some questions about group CBT, the usual: what is it like? what were your experiences? etc. etc. As well as how can I breach this subject of medication to my mum and help her understand that my brain chemistry &amp; behavior is not something I can just control or change instantly?

Thank you so much for reading this block of text ! I feel reassured knowing if even though there aren't many people who have or understand OCD around me I can always just check this subreddit and scroll or post !",OCD,1582245058,P3RSXN4,12,1,True,2020-02-20
"Making Progress, but Still a Long Way to Go","It‚Äôs not really necessary to share this, but I‚Äôve found that it does me some good to confide in 63,000 people who understand. I‚Äôve made a good amount of progress these last couple weeks. It started with advice I received on this subreddit, which is that I must accept the possibility that what I fear could really be happening, however unlikely it is. I have to learn to live with that uncertainty. A second thing that is helping me is a new framework for understanding what‚Äôs going on inside my mind. My therapist separated the mind into two parts: the emotional mind, and the logical mind. The logical mind is the one that understands that I have OCD and anxiety and that all the ‚Äúsymptoms‚Äù of other problems that I experience are just a reflection of those fears. Unfortunately, the emotional mind is the one driving the bus, and its core beliefs are not in line with the logical mind. My emotional mind is scared shitless of many things, mainly that I am losing the ability to understand language and that that means I have dementia. My therapist gave me a method for slowly changing the dysfunctional core beliefs of my emotional mind in order to bring them in line with my logical mind, and I am starting to implement it. Monday was the first day in a long, long time where my thoughts lost enough power to leave me free to enjoy the day. It reminded me that there‚Äôs more to life than suffering. I want people who are struggling to know that there is always a path to recovery, and that it will be full of discouraging set backs. You have to slowly learn to take them in stride and keep moving. Over the past two days, my thoughts have slowly returned. I feel spent. My mind feels fried. My short term memory in particular is having some trouble. Despite that, I will do my best to make sure these things don‚Äôt prevent me from realigning my core beliefs to be in line with my logical mind.",OCD,1582246229,Catalaunian-Plains,3,1,True,2020-02-20
I can't believe there was ever a time when my day wasn't just a constant stream of intrusive thoughts,"Today I was thinking about how I've always exhibited OCD symptoms and tendencies, but that my everyday existence wasn't plagued by OCD to the extent it is now, and I find that really interesting. Even as recently as a year ago, I'd experience an intrusive thought or maybe do a few compulsions, but my anxiety levels all around were sooo much lower. Now, it's like my day is just: 

""Should I wear my headphones to class? You might look like a lesbian in them. That's absurd, just wear them. Wait you're picking at your lip again. People will notice. Why was that guy staring at me? It's the headphones isn't it? Maybe your lip looks bad. Or maybe your outfit is really stupid and you didn't notice it before. Stop pulling at your shirt. Wait that car looks just like my mom's. Is that an omen? Is she going to be in a wreck today? If I text her to be careful, she won't get in a crash. No, that's silly. But if you don't text her, you'll have caused the crash. I'll text her. There's that cute guy from my class, I should say hi. But maybe you don't think he's cute and it's really just society telling you you should think he's cute and you're really a lesbian. Am I attracted to that girl over there? I don't think so. Look at him and then look at her. Still unsure. Look again. Again. Wait now I'm panicking, should I be confused?? Stop picking your lip, everyone is staring. Aw that's a cute dog, I miss my dogs. It'll be a shame when they die. No I don't want to think about that. Yes you do. You'll regret not spending more time with them when they're dead, just like you'll regret not texting your mom to prevent that crash today..."" 


I miss the days of just seeing a person and not trying to assess my attraction to them or lack thereof. I miss simple coincidences not terrifying me. I miss not having to ask everyone for reassurance all the time. Do other people remember times when OCD was just background noise and didn't dominate your thoughts? Has anyone managed to make it back to that state? I'm seeing a therapist and working on ERP, but it just gets frustrating sometimes.",OCD,1582247089,incompetent9871,15,1,True,2020-02-20
Are there any over the counter medicines or other remedies that help with dealing with this?,"For background, I have contamination OCD and as such have obsessive cleanliness. I can still function normally in every day life. However, I have to be careful that certain objects I need or use (keys, phone, wallet and contents, games, laptop) don't get contaminated as well as making sure my hands and arms up to elbow don't get contaminated either. Otherwise I'll have to clean the object with antibacterial wipes and potentially rewash my hands for much longer than I want to (I've been losing self-control over the past 2 years).

When I don't necessarily need to use those objects or it's just not practical or necessary for the object to be 100% clean, I'm not nearly as anal about it, but I try my best to still keep things and my hands clean. For example, I use a wipe to open my driver's front door on my car but don't for my passenger's front door since I need a ""dirty"" side so to speak. 

But now to my question in the title, what are my options? I know given how severe my case seeing some kind of specialist would be the better option, but I don't see it being practical. They'll just ask me to do things that I'll won't want to do, not to mention that I couldn't go to their office in the first place. If I have to drive myself in my car there then I risk contaminating my car because there's no guarantee that I'll be able to sufficiently wash my hands to my liking there in order to get back in my car.

Constantly Checking for Spots/Stains,"Hello r/OCD, I am new to this subreddit, though I have been dealing with OCD for several years. 

My symptoms mainly deal with stains, spots on clothes, and dirty hands. I wash my hands probably 30 or more times per day, usually for a minute or longer at a time. When I go out to eat or am doing anything with my hands, I get easily distracted by the possibility that my hands are dirty and they will subsequently get everything they touch dirty. I must keep my hands perfectly clean at all times, or I have intense anxiety. I usually carry around hands wipes in my pockets, and use them even if my hands look and feel clean. 

I also worry about my clothes constantly. I will ""scan"" them for spots or stains, and even if I don't see anything, I will scan them again and again until someone notices my distraction and tells me to stop. 

I am wondering if anyone else deals with this type of compulsory clothes-checking. I know that clean hands are a very common compulsion, but I haven't heard much about clean clothes.",OCD,1582250520,TheK00l198,1,1,True,2020-02-20

My (28M) mental health issues affect me more than my SO (23F) but I am struggling.,"I (28M) have been with my SO (23F) for five years. Around two years ago I had a meltdown that I am still recovering from. During that time, I've suffered from depression and OCD. That first year I was basically just in my bed. The ""is she the one, what if this, what of that,"" questions became overwhelming, debilitating, and irrational. I quit my job, stopped going to college, and just faded away. I started school again but no job...and she still supports me.

My SO and I still are each other's ride or die. We spend a ton of time together, go out, do little things for each other and talk about *all* of this. This is why I know this has affected her too, which kills me because some of the shit I told her was just fucking insanity. We have changed since we first met. That is the nature of things but it is also scary. Sometimes, I don‚Äôt know who I am because I don‚Äôt want to be who I was and I don‚Äôt know where I am headed. Although I have my good days, being as carefree and fearless as I once was isn't quite here yet.

I just don't know how to let go of all the negative thoughts that I have in order to move past this dark time in my life. I have always cut everyone out of my life to start over but this time, I don't want to despite it being the only way I know how to. It just seems wrong. I've tried meds and they have made my libido worse among other things. And I've struck out with the therapist I've tried. There are times when I want to give up on us and just be alone to figure myself out. To go test out these OCD thoughts I am having to see if it is OCD or reality. But when I do go out without her, things don‚Äôt matter as much. I am just there. She tends to bring purpose to mundane activities.

I am just lost right now and she really is the only person who gets me and is there for me. She is such a beautiful person, and being the way I am around her sometimes can make me hate myself. If she reads this, she knows she makes me a better person.

"Anyone with ""just right"" or ""perfectionism"" ocd?","Hey, newbie to the group. (21 female) Have had OCD all my life but it really manifested during my meth addiction in my teens. I've been clean for 2 and a half years now (yay!) but my ocd is worse now than ever. A lot of it is grooming related, I don't pick my skin but I obsessively rinse my hands with water, not because I'm afraid of contamination but because it feels ""just right""

I have to brush my hair in a certain way, I count the strokes of the washcloth on my body in the shower and even the strokes of my razor when I'm shaving and if my routine doesn't go ""perfect"" it ruins my whole day. I have to count the spaces in between my teeth when flossing and I can't accidentally hit the tooth I didn't intend to with the flosser or else it ruins my whole routine and I have an anxiety attack and am distressed until I eat next and can floss again.

I waste money on manicures and pedicures even though I am really good at doing my own nails just because I feel that I can't do it ""perfect"" enough but if a professional does it for me it feels just right and I can relax. 

I have a total of 8 grooming related routines that are very time consuming. I don't fear that anything bad will happen if I don't do these perfectly, but I feel extremely uncomfortable and anxious to the point where it will ruin the rest of my day and I wont feel myself again until I can complete them correctly. Sometimes on bad days when one thing after the other doesn't go ""just right"" I'll have a breakdown and hyperventilate and cry, but always in private. I don't let this affect my personal relationships but nobody close to me realizes how much it actually affects me, even though I crack jokes about my OCD sometimes.

I don't even wear eye makeup (although I don't need it, I am very pretty el naturel!) because I have a makeup routine with just my face foundation and powder and count the strokes of the makeup brush on my face that I do every day, and even though I am good at putting on eye makeup it never feels just right so I hardly wear it.

I also do things like dump out my purse 3 times a day and put everything back in ""just right"" in fear of finding a wrapper or clutter that doesn't belong, even though I never unknowingly toss anything like that in my purse to begin with. I do this with my bedroom too, I go through all my folded clothes and refold all of them perfectly and empty out my drawers and storage boxes and put everything back into place and re align my furniture so it's perfectly aligned with the walls multiple times a week.

Omg the realization that i have severe OCD is killing me right now,"I am a 21 year old male, when i was younger i had a lot of ""rituals"". I had to take ""perfect"" mental images of something, walk on something a certain amount of times. I remember playing video games with friends and always having to touch the VERY (*VERY*) tip top of the lamp next to me. The garage door (leading into the house) always had to be locked. I would run in the garage, grab what i need, run back in and lock the door. But i always needed to kick the door behind me with my right foot and it HAD to be a satisfying thud. This would knock the ""getting chased feeling"" away. I was taking a lot of medicine but didn't think it was that bad. Holy shit, i think it's that bad. I stopped taking all my medicine cold turkey a year or two ago. I wanted to be ""normal"", my family had enough pills on the fridge and it was embarrassing/disgusting to me. I felt great. I felt like a different person, i could feel my emotions and get natural highs of happiness. It was like the commercials where a foggy film is taken off and everything's clear. But as of lately (last year) ive noticed it's getting bad. I was able to kick about everything but my thoughts are going crazy, i tense up my arms, legs, and core while shaking when i get excited. The duration depends on how excited. I catch myself always looking at the dead center of my perfectly round closet door knob. The middle of my fan. Looking at the corner of my tv and making a diagonal slant with my finger. I've also never been able to focus in school, it's like im daydreaming against my will. I would notice im daydreaming then tell my self to stop but now I'm in a loop of realizing im daydreaming and telling myself to stop. I give up and let my mind wonder to something else and before i know it class is over. I was able to get by in everything but math. It got so bad I had to drop out and eventually got my GED. I only got my GED passing math by two points and probably couldn't do it again. I feel lost and kinda scared. I thought these pills were pushed too easily because kids exaggerate and im in the USA. Does anyone else have these symptoms/rituals, and which ones? Im mostly looking for people who tense thier body's and shake/and are trapped daydreaming. But i would like to talk about all.

"Have less OCD because of meds, but feeling spaced out and not myself in the mornings? Been taking melatonin too","Hi guys  
So i've had severe OCD for quite some time. My medication seems to be lessening it (zoloft 200mg). I've noticed this week that I'm just really not freaking out as much over my OCD thoughts. I am a little weirded out though. I've been taking 9mg of melatonin at night a few nights this week. I've also been feeling spaced out, like i'm not in my head, mainly in the mid morning when i wake up or often early afternoon.   
For example, I get up and go to the bathroom. I will notice how blue the tiles look. Are they usually this blue? The lines seem crisper and the bathroom seems brighter. I didn't turn the light on. Why didn't I turn the light on? Then I go to the mirror/sink to wash my hands, and i'm just kinda perplexed I guess at my reflection. I immediately know it's me, it's just kinda like 'huh. okay.'. Like i'm really noticing things but also feeling completely not myself and out of my head.   
The other morning I woke up and i was just looking at my hand and when i stopped being half asleep i was like okay....what on earth. The next morning I also was staring at my drawers and wondering if they'd always had those lines on them. Again, when I properly woke up, i was like what on earth is going on here.

Is this another obsession?,"Hi all! 

I've struggled with OCD my whole life and was diagnosed years ago.  I have studied myself intensely to identify which things are obsessions and which are just personality quirks. I do this so I can identify what I should work on changing through exposure therapy.

I've been stumped recently. I can't tell what this is.

I'm not asking for medical advice, I just want to know if any of you have dealt with this and can tell me if it's a result of the OCD.

I seem to have an irrational determination to finish things efficiently, even if it sacrifices entertainment. That may not make sense, so let me give some examples. I play a lot of video games, they are a sanctuary for me and provide a lot of peace. Recently though, I've noticed myself dropping enjoyment of the game so I can beat it as fast as possible. I'll skip cutscenes and side missions even though I know I'll enjoy those because I feel like I have to finish the game. Unfortunately, whenever I finish, I never feel fulfilled. A different example is TV shows. I'll skip intros and sometimes lose sight of what just happened in the episode because I'm so hell-bent on getting through the season.

OCD/superstitious behaviors due to anxiety about losing loved ones?,"I have GAD and I was at one point diagnosed with OCD, but have been doing fairly well since (that was 8ish years ago). One thing that persists is anxiety around my loved ones dying and resultant superstition. I classified this as just anxiety, but people have pointed out that my behaviors in response sound a tad OCD. I was wondering whether anyone else has dealt with this and what may have worked to decrease your anxiety levels.

It used to be centered around my parents, but now it's focused on my boyfriend. We've created sappy little goodnight/goodbye routines, and there's nothing inherently wrong with that, but what is troublesome is the level of anxiety I feel if I miss one. For example, we have a series of things we say to each other when we say goodnight (e.g. I say ""Come back to me real soon"" and he says ""Always, I promise""), and when I'm typing it out, I have to restart if I make a typo, I can't just correct it and move on. One time I forgot to do part of our goodbye routine and freaked out, because I was like, now something is going to happen to him and I'll never forgive myself. We have matching bracelets/rings and I've gotten upset with him before for not wearing them sometimes, because I feel like they connect us and therefore will protect him. Et cetera.

Like I said, there's nothing wrong with doing lame couples things, but I'm also realizing that the difference is some couples would be fine if they skipped or forgot a routine, whereas I need to make sure I follow it exactly. My boyfriend is also a police officer, which is not a good profession for a loved one to be in if you have anxiety about your loved ones' safety lol, so that heightens it. But I've gotten less anxious when he's at work over the past couple years; I tend to worry more about him having a freak accident. It's definitely worse too when I'm in school because he lives 100 miles away and I only see him once a week.

Anyway, just wondering if this rings a bell with anyone else and if so how you've managed to get over or at least cope with it. I really don't want to not do the routines because I am so superstitious it would cause so much anxiety I don't think I could cope, but I suppose that's part of the issue. Anyway, maybe this doesn't sound like an OCD behavior in which case forget it, but people in the anxiety subreddit are the ones who said my superstitions sounded more like an OCD thing than just a GAD thing, so I thought I'd pop over here!",OCD,1582317061,likeaschoolgirl,1,1,True,2020-02-21

I'm on the brink.....,"I've posted here before looking for advice (under a different username). I posted how I get these obsessive thoughts about my GF. How these thoughts led me to distrust her. In December I found out that she had still been talking and sexting with a guy from a previous relationship. This was after she said she stopped in October After I found out we fought, argued and debated the issue, but ultimately I decided to make it work. Having OCD obviously made trusting her more difficult, but I worked at it. I worked really hard at it. The reason being that I loved her so much, I just couldn't picture life without her.
Things started going better. Slowly but surely I started to trust her again. The obsessive thoughts became less and less. This past Wednesday we had an argument over something stupid which ultimately led to her leaving me. She then told me she didn't stop speaking to him in December and they have been talking and sexting all along. I didn't give up. I thought if she felt the same way about me we could work it out. Everything came out today. She told me she likes sexting with other men and me preventing her made her feel controlled. She also said that she wouldn't leave him. 
I'm broken. It feels like all the obsessive thoughts I didn't have for the past few weeks are hitting me now. I don't think I've had an anxiety attack like this before. I'm shaking, sweating, the palpitations are killing me and I can't make it stop. I don't know what to do. I'm really suffering.

"OCD, sobriety and going to AA","I recently quit drinking, I‚Äôve been going to AA for about a month now. It‚Äôs been really helpful it some ways, I‚Äôd certainly not be sober now if it wasn‚Äôt for the program. However, my OCD is starting to make it almost equal parts damaging...

1: I obsess hard over sober time, I‚Äôm obsessed with that number going up, and getting a stupid chip. When I relapsed it felt like the end of the fucking world, and I still beat myself up over it a week later. 

2: I‚Äôm obsessing hard over approval, and doing things right. Pushing myself too hard at times, not trying at all other times since I can‚Äôt do things ‚Äúperfectly‚Äù.  I feel like I‚Äôm sober so people will be proud of me instead of being sober to better myself at this point. 

3: Prayer freaks me out. I had bad religious OCD as a kid, and prayer triggers that, even though I‚Äôm not praying to a god. I get freaked out because I‚Äôm like ‚Äúfuck what if God is real and hears me and decides to smite me for praying to ‚Äúthe void‚Äù and not him‚Äù

4: I‚Äôm scared of fuckin‚Äô step 4 since it involves taking moral inventory. I know I am kind of shitty, but I also know I‚Äôm not as shitty as my OCD makes me feel. So idk how to manage that when I get to it. 

5: obsessing over convos has been severe. I talk to my sponsor daily, then talk to people at meetings multiple times a week. My biggest symptom is obsessing over conversations, whether they be verbal or text, and having so many convos with new people has been triggering as fuck. I‚Äôll obsess over a conversation for weeks, feeling judged, or fearing that I said the wrong thing.

Moral/responsibility OCD,"Hi all,

I've primarily had contamination OCD for the last 10 years. Think showering and washing my hair multiple times a day, hand washing, washing clothes multiple times, throwing things out because they're 'contaminated', etc etc. 

But over the past few years, I've noticed a moral/responsibility OCD creeping in, and I actually find this much harder. I think that might be because there's no compulsion I can perform to make the anxiety go away. I just have to sit with it. 

I fixate on how ""good"" a person I am. I agonise that I've made the ""wrong"" decisions and will be punished for them by the universe somehow. My ultimate fear is causing harm to someone. I really try to be a ""perfect"" human being but obviously, sometimes I fail at that. I look back at my whole life and think things like, ""What if saying/doing that ruined a person's life or causes them to commit suicide?"" 

I base my whole value on how good/useful I am to the world, so when I think I've fallen short in whatever way, it's so hard. I've been feeling incredibly anxious about one situation for about a week straight now and I don't know what to do.

"I Need Advice for my GF, Please help me","So I never imagined to be posting on here, but i don't know what to do, or how to help or support my gf.

Before you read... we are both under the age of 18 so please keep that in mind if you do give any advice... unfortunately my age keeps me from doing alot of things I wish I had the power to do...

My gf has the obsessive compulsion to completely keep her hands clean. Now I understand that it's a common thing, but it's starting to be becoming severe issue and a danger to her health. Before it's just been washing her hands about 20 times a day because of what she eats, touches, or even smells. And that's been manageable. 

Now recently she's been starting to take medication for it, and I don't know if thats what is making things more severe, but recently she has decided to STARVE herself... Furthermore, she refuses do anything that'll make her wash her hands, she won't eat, she won't touch anything, I myself have to make sure my hands don't smell or look dirt before touching her. I'm not annoyed or anything, frankly i'm just worried that this is too far... especially starving herself... I've tried 

As for the reason she is deciding to not eat is because recently teachers at school have been pressuring her to  hurry in using the restroom, even though she takes a very long time because of her OCD. She's tried to explain to the but they for some reason don't believe that OCD exists and continue to pressure her. This has caused her anxiety to spike severely in the last couple of days which has lead to her making the decision to STARVE herself, so she won't have to wash her hands at all...

"Girlfriend, distance, OCD and video games?","Hey guys.

Me (26) and gf (22) have been dating for 6 months and are smitten. She came out as having ROCD, anxiety and a lot of issues stemming from a tragedy in her teens, and some bad exes, this was about a month or so into the relationship (it wasn't easy for her and she consistently amazes me with how tough she is).

We're both trying to figure this out the best we can and she's started getting help from GPs and she's seeing about specialists etc. Most of the effort is being made on her part and I'm happy to do what I can when I can how I can.

The wee catch is that she's currently in university in a different city (close enough to visit regularly) so there's a limited amount I can do.

She's not a gamer but we had a really cracking time playing Witcher III together.

So here's my plan. I've ordered her an xbox one and several games for her birthday. My thinking here is that she took to gaming like a real geek (RPG fantasy is apparently her thing (she loves LotR)) and that playing Skyrim or Lego LotR might help her chill out when she's got the intrusive thoughts or anxiety spirals. 

I was wondering if there's any evidence to suggest that video games can be helpful in anxiety and OCD situations? Especially if there's a sort of emotional connection involved?

Struggling with sexual orientation OCD,"I‚Äôve been struggling for a long time, this first popped up for me in middle school and went away, then again now (I‚Äôm a 24 year old woman). I‚Äôm with a man who I love and who I want to be with, but I keep having intrusive thoughts about how I must actually be a lesbian. I came out as bi a few years ago but honestly I don‚Äôt even think that‚Äôs true? I have gone on a date with a woman and even experimented with women but none of it really felt the same as I am when I‚Äôm with a man I like (which is really nice and exciting). I went through some trauma which made me afraid of men for awhile and I think that‚Äôs why I came out as bi. Because when I think logically, I can‚Äôt really pinpoint a single girl I‚Äôve ever actually had a crush on and wanted to date. When I think about fantasizing about me vs women, there are so many men I find attractive and who I like to fantasize about but I can‚Äôt really even think of a woman who I‚Äôd like to fantasize about. 

The whole idea of comphet really freaks me out though. In high school I was terrified of the boys I had crushes on and I worry that means I was repulsed by them. I also have had intense friendships with women and gotten jealous if they‚Äôre closer to other people, which also makes me afraid that I actually liked them and didn‚Äôt realize. In college this came up a bit. I felt really lonely during this time (I was single) and like I was being forgotten by everyone who was dating people. Like my friend would start dating someone and then leave me behind and I felt really abandoned. So when one of my girl friends kind of picked me as her closest friend I finally felt special and like someone had chosen me. But now I worry that means I actually wanted to date her. Our friendship ended awhile ago and it was really painful so that scares me even more, like what if I wanted to be with her? 

I am just so scared because I‚Äôm worried the fact that I‚Äôve legitimately been through a questioning phase means this must not be OCD and it must be real. My biggest fear is I‚Äôll have to leave my boyfriend, who I love and want to spend my life with. It‚Äôs just so miserable. The thoughts are constant and so depressing. I‚Äôve had intrusive thoughts about sexual things since I was a kid. Honestly, what first led me to believe I was bi was going through HOCD in middle school, and then I stopped feeling anxious about the thoughts so I thought it must mean I‚Äôm actually bi.

I'm gonna be tested for OCD in about three months.,"I have struggled with OCD like symptoms most of my life. When i was a child i had a few symptoms but it really became worse when i reached about 13. Started having compulsions that would make me hurt myself because i felt i had to. My life was shit back then. Now that i am 18 years old i have started going to a psychologist. Talked about a lot of different things but also about my compulsions. I am actually going to get a new psychologist (which is sad, she really was a great psychologist.) But before that i told her i would like to be tested for OCD. She gave me a test to see if it was worth contacting someone (If im going to get a diagnosis it has to be via someone else). When we was done with the test she told me that if i had gone to a psychologist a few years back (when it was way worse than now) i most likely would have gotten the diagnosis. She also told me that it seems like i do not have OCD i just have more compulsions than usual. 

I find this a bit weird and tbh it worries me. Pretty much my entire life i have struggled with compulsions... blinking awareness, fear of being gay, touching my eye or punching myself (it had to be a number that you could divide. (For example 2, 4 or 6 times), a kind of fear of cheating in video games (restarting the same game every time i felt something was cheaty (Basically i have been struggling to finish any games the past few months), terrible and unwanted pictures, afraid of pretty much touching any girl (afraid to cheat on my girlfriend). I also had stuff like this when i was a child. For example doing a special hand motion and if i did not do it i was afraid my mother would die, or having to align the hair of my LEGO figures so it was one hundred percent forward (would spend a lot of time doing that haha).

&amp;#x200B;

I am gonna be honest and say i am a bit afraid. I do not mean to sound like an asshole or offend anyone. But i am a bit afraid that most of the struggles of my life has been pretty much just ""you have more symptoms than average"" and nothing else. I still struggle with shit like this and if in three months i am just gonna get told i have more symptoms than average it will hurt me in a way... I know that i should probably be thankful if i do not have OCD but in a way it hurts me. So much of my life i have struggled with symptoms to the point where i cry only to be told ""You do not have OCD. You just have more symptoms than average.""

&amp;#x200B;

I just needed to vent a bit. I am sorry if this offended anyone in any way. That is not my intention at all.  I guess one of the reasons i am upset is because i would like to be able to use it as an excuse for myself in a way. When i have compulsions that make me feel bad i would like to tell myself ""Its okay. You have a diagnosis. Its not your fault"". I have been told ""everyone has compulsions from time to time"" and i would like to be able to say that i actually do have the diagnosis. That what i have is not just ""normal"". I guess i will see.

I have literally thought myself into a hole here and now I'm stuck. I can't move, I can't do anything. I'm just locked up. An analogy to this I thought of which is somewhat interesting: the entire world is a broken pile of puzzle pieces  and compulsions are like constantly trying to put them together as I go, only to get overwhelmed with the fact that literally everywhere I turn, I have to solve the puzzle. Most people do not solve attempt to solve the puzzles.

I'm just ""locked"" inside. This may be evident in my writing, it's messy and tangential. I need to unlock myself somehow so I can finally get to this task. I am so close and I've busted my goddamn ass to get here. I Just have to finish the task.

Anyway, I deviated a bit from my post title.

job frustration,"Heyo, 31, OCD+Depression+GAD

My job is kinda sorta like proofreading. I read papers, make sure they have correct information, and make sure they don't have information they're not supposed to have.

As I dreaded, my OCD *loves* fucking with it. 

I can realistically spend at least a minute or two longer than needed staring at any given sheet. I know what I need to do, I know what I need to look out for, I know that the info that needs to be accurate actually matches up, and yet I'll still not feel totally ""certain"" for a few extra seconds.

At one point today, I spent at least 3 minutes making sure I made a copy of the correct sheet. I was looking at the copy and looking at the original, running through the entire sheet from top to bottom to make sure all the details matched. Of course it did. But I couldn't convince myself that it did for a couple of minutes.

Thankfully I'm not under any sort of strict time limit, the job requires quality rather than quantity. But it's also not the kind of thing you want to make too many errors on either.

Has anyone had a similar situation? Got any tips? I'm off now til Tuesday so I'm gonna be devoting a lot of time to figuring out what exactly I can do to improve my mindset while I'm at work so that I don't keep getting stuck and can also potentially boss back the OCD. 

I knew this type of job might be bad for my disorder once I saw how the job worked, but..I need this. It fits perfectly into my life right now in a variety of ways and I don't even want to *consider* leaving.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",OCD,1582336901,kaizokukaiju,2,1,True,2020-02-21

I wonder what I would be like now if I didn‚Äôt go to catholic school as a kid.,"A huge problem problem that I have is the idea that people are reading my mind and that my thoughts get attached to objects I am touching as I think them.

Since then I feel like I haven‚Äôt been able to experience freedom in my own head. The problem did evolve into me believing that anything I said or thought would happen, even if I was sarcastic, so I had to be extra careful. I even have a quick mantra/prayer thing that I will, out of habit, repeatedly say in my head so that my words and thoughts won‚Äôt harm me. But now it‚Äôs gotten even worse and things like pictures on my Instagram explore page trigger anxiety. This happens when something that happens to show up on there shows a phobia of mine.

It‚Äôs like how in Wicca, stones and flowers and minerals each have a meaning and energy that comes along with it. That‚Äôs almost how I seem to be viewing Instagram posts now.

Clomipramine,"I was diagnosed in childhood and tried many SSRIs throughout adolescence in attempt to get it under control. I won‚Äôt go into the details, but it lead me to the decision to never to use pharmaceuticals for my mental health ever again. It was bad.

Throughout the last decade I‚Äôve tried very hard to handle my symptoms, and have gotten them under control on my own for the most part. I still have moments of breaking down in tears over intrusive thoughts, but I wait until I‚Äôm alone to let it out. 

This week it finally hit me. I‚Äôve been in denial about how bad things have been, not wanting to admit this diagnosis was legitimate. I didn‚Äôt think I needed treatment, figured I could think my way out of it, but it‚Äôs been hell. I can‚Äôt separate my fear from reality anymore. 

I had an emergency appointment with a psychiatrist today, and asked him to prescribe me Clomipramine. I started my first dose tonight.

I guess I‚Äôm selfishly asking for reassurance. I have to work Monday, and my mind has to be crystal clear. I work in a Pharmacy and the thought of making an error or QT miscalculation terrifies me.

I have been avoiding cleaning my house/laundry because I‚Äôm overwhelmed and I know the right way to do it, and it exhausts me to think about doing it all the right way.

I wash my hands/ use sanitizer so much that my hands are darker and redder than the rest of my arm.

Just had a mental breakdown over releasing mice,"My parents set out sticky traps for house mice. I told them not to use those because of how much excessive suffering these traps caused but they wouldn't listen. I made a visit to their place today and they actually rescued two of the mice from the traps and kept them in a bin. Told me they were waiting for me to release them. So without thinking straight I went along with my dad as he unceremoniously dumped them into the woods a ways off. 

I started regretting it immediately after. I knew this was an extended death sentence. They would probably slowly freeze or starve to death. Soon afterwards I couldn't hold back my guilt any longer. I went back to the woods and both of them were still in the immediate vicinity. One was crawling around on a fence post. I managed to get it in the bin, but for some reason I wavered again and let it back out. I could have saved it then but I didn't!!!!! I was afraid of what my parents would have thought. I had a panic attack, completely unsure of what to do, ashamed of my own insanity. I went back home and immediately regretted it again. This time I willed my resolve to save the mice.

"Guilt, paranoia, disassociation, and self-hate","I (23F) have always been extremely anxious, prone to excessive rumination, and dangerously low on self-confidence. Last year, while working on an assignment for one of my programming courses, I looked up some code online and that got me into a huge deal of trouble as it was against course policy. I was ashamed and racked with guilt, and my grade dropped from A to B+ (not the issue here). However, the university put me through an ethics seminar (as is custom) and now I am beyond paranoid about everything I do (for instance, I have been so paranoid about inadvertently ""cheating"" that I don't even ask the graduate teaching assistants for help as I feel it would be ""unfair""). I have begun to question everything, even things I thought I knew so well. Morality makes me extremely anxious, and I have begun to doubt my own moral compass. I have lost all faith and conviction in my own actions, and when I ruminate over things I've said or done, I feel guilty and ashamed; so much so that I've apologized to people for my insensitive and cruel behavior (to their utmost surprise). This has reached a point where I can't objectively assess my actions or behavior -- in fact, I can't disassociate thoughts from reality. I somehow convince myself that I've messed up and that pushes me into this state of despair and self-hatred -- I've even begun to entertain thoughts of self-harm and death (not suicidal though).

"OCD, Coronavirus, &amp; me","I'm finding it really hard to deal with my OCD lately. I just got over a cocd about catching ringworm. The thing about getting over something, I seem to catch a new obsession right after. Right now, it's centered about Coronavirus. Before I was somewhat managing, actively tried to fight it, for the past three weeks. It was fine, still went out and bought things, didnt really care about being ""clean"". Had some days where I'd obsessed but I'd fight it and move on. But this week it's been crazy. I've been on an emotional roller coaster.

I've now started ""decontaminating"" anything I buy from the store to online. Wait a bit and then decontaminate again. Will use hand sanitizer each time I touch something, will also enforce it on bf ):. Would use hand sanitizer or my wipes on my phone to decontaminate it as well. Anytime I come home, I put my ""contaminated"" clothing into a bag and hop into the shower. I wash my clothing twice. Then proceed to decontaminate doorknobs etc. I avoid going out as much as possible. I only go out for school or if I'm being dragged out for errands. 
My issue isnt on me being sick, but the idea of getting my parents sick. They are older and have some health problems. So I fear the worst, and i spend my nights crying because i think i brought something contaminated in that'll harm them.
I used to read the stats on it and it helped me fight my thoughts with facts. I knew the risks of researching. I now research about it at least 3 hours a day and now the data is reinforcing my fears. My mind is exhausted and I'm reaching my breaking point.

Do I have OCD?,"So this post might be long, might not, I guess we will find out. I just would like some advice and insight from people that have OCD.

So I have a lot of obsessive thoughts and compulsions. I can have obsessive thoughts about anything really. For example, I have PTSD from childhood abuse, and I have obsessive thoughts about my triggers and the abuse. If I see little boys I will get triggered because I imagine them being abused like I was. Or I will obsess over timelines. Like if I listen to a song that came out in 1978, I will get obsessive thoughts about how many children have been abused from 1978 to now and I will get triggered. I‚Äôm basically always triggered because of this. Always hyper vigilant. A few days ago I was obsessing over a foster kid that I knew on my street. I know that abuse is rampant in the foster system, and I wanted to protect him if I could do I could not stop thinking about taking him and telling him that he can come to me is anyone touches him in any way physically or sexually. I go to knock on the door if the foster home, and it turns out that he was sent away to a different home and I had no way to contact him. This made me obsess over him being abused by some POS monster that I couldn‚Äôt get to. I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about it. Once again got triggered. In September I had to go see a counsellor for anxiety because I couldn‚Äôt stop obsessing over the future. Over what I wanted to do, over getting a job that I could be independent, about starting a family, about moving out. I am 18 and my mom told me to stop worrying about so much at once and take it slow but I couldn‚Äôt stop. I probably spent hours just doing random research on whatever came to mind from minimum salary needed to support oneself to homelessness. I didn‚Äôt want to think about any of it but I couldn‚Äôt stop. I had multiple panic attacks and was in a constant high of anxiety for weeks. I couldn‚Äôt even eat anything, which if you know me you know that‚Äôs not right. I‚Äôm not fat because I have a high metabolism (I am 185-190), but I eat like there‚Äôs no tomorrow. I also have compulsions. I have an obsession with symmetry. Everything I do or build needs to be symmetrical. If I am making something in minecraft, it needs to be symmetrical as a whole, and the different parts need to be built symmetrically while I am doing it. Like say I am building a rectangle, and I place the blocks left, right, left, right, left, right, then the next rectangle needs to be right, left, etc. It‚Äôs like a fractal if symmetry. It like say I touch a door knob with my left hand, I then need to touch it with my right hand, and if I turn it left I need to also turn it right. This means 4 turns of the door knob every time I get the compulsion. Or say I am sitting down and the arm rest is on my left thigh, the other arm rest must also be on my left thigh. Or the foot rest needs to hav both feet on it touching the same parts of my feet or it just feels off and I can‚Äôt ignore it. If I scratch my left cheek I need to scratch the right cheek. You get he idea.

Stnchronicities,"Back in 2016 my class in school had a person that was physically ugly (everyone agreed on that fact, this person just didnt look after themselves at all). 

Theres nothing wrong with that but...


One day someone said I kinda looked like them, even tho a lot of people called me pretty, but I guess I looked like that person because I had greasier hair that day or idk, but this event really triggered OCD rituals in me and I started seeing signs that it is true that im physically ugly too.

And those are the signs/synchronicities that happened to me:

‚Ä¢ Back in 2018 in november 12, which was monday I saw that person out in the street.
After that, back in 2019 november 11 (11-11 sign!!) AND also monday I saw that person again too. Which is also ONE year later.

‚Ä¢ UPDATE: Back in feburary 2019 I saw that same person on the street. I had the feeling that Iam going to see them on 2020 feburary again and TODAY i saw them again!

OCD around being possessed?? Lol,"Hi! I know it sounds crazy but I have this really upsetting OCD lately. See last April I made a university film project (I‚Äôm a filmmaker) and it was meant to be a horror / surrealism film. In the film I dressed up as the joker and I cut a lamb heart into quarters and served it to the other actors. I then washed the face paint off my face to represent ‚Äònew beginnings‚Äô. Like there was meant to be a metaphor about letting go of bad parts of yourself and becoming a better person, also about relationships and how you give your heart to different people over and over again. Anyway it wasn‚Äôt meant to be witchcraft or anything like that, just a cool freaky film with some metaphors about what I was going through at the time ( a hard time with a break up and something else traumatic). Anyway I had a bit of a hard time after I made the film but I got over it quickly then I met my beautiful fianc√© whom has made me so happy and feel loved and calm etc. Anyway for the last 2 /3 weeks I‚Äôve been incredibly depressed and anxious - it started by me thinking I was an awful person who didn‚Äôt deserve to live because i cut up an animals heart (bare in mind animal was Dead and I bought this organ from a butcher ). Then the OCD escalated into convincing myself I‚Äôve sold my soul to the devil and that‚Äôs why I feel this crippling anxiety (as punishment) - and that this anxiety is never going to go away or end and I‚Äôm never going to feel love again, happy again, horny again or anything. All I‚Äôm going to feel is anxious and empty for the rest of my life. Can anyone help calm my thoughts? Like I‚Äôve Actually convinced myself this is true. Deleted loads of versions and original copies of the film, took it down from my Vimeo. Checked with other actors that they didn‚Äôt feel possessed. Sorry I know this is obscure.

Then I‚Äôm worrying about drinking our tap water because of the chemicals we keep under the sink. even though we have a well and the inspector said it was fine.

Or maybe the tap water in the downstairs bathroom is contaminated with something that can cause aggression. And I recently just had my heart broken, and I‚Äôm worried that I will never find another girl If maybe later down the road I become an aggressive person due to chemical contaminants. This really just sucks, I‚Äôm so worried about becoming an angry person even though I really only get mad when I‚Äôm playing video games or find something to be unnecessary. I cannot remember the last time I was pissed off. Like legitimately. But yet I‚Äôm still worried about this.

Maybe you will understand,"So as i wrote a week ago, i started with medication therapy.(escitalopram)
My diagnosis is anxiety/depression and ocd. 
But i dont know will medication help me to solve the dominant problem in my life, numbness. Emotional and sexual. I suffered from harm and suicidal ocd for 3 years together with GaD and social phobia, where it suddenly switched to Hocd(doubting my sexuality). I was 22 then and im male. In the moment of swichting my suicidal was worst ever and when i started thinking im gay, something switched off my emotions. Its not total numbness, from 1-10 its 7 but i had periods of 10 and periods of 5-6. But what kills me is that sexual part, where i liked women for my whole life, now i lost that desire and since i lost that desire i feel that numbness. Its lke biogical me and mental are not in harmony. I dont get these spontaneous feelings of crush. 
And i lost interests in everything i did in my life. 
I feel like my male organ is on some kind of stand bye, almost dead. Im doing nofap also. 
But i wont be able to live my life like this but i dont know how to get my desire for women back. 
Those previous themes were harder but this one took most of me. 
And one more question. Sometimes when i get rush of emotions when i get mad or sad or something i feel i cant control it and start feeling im losing control, like im going mad,is that ocd or something worse, something else?",OCD,1582367608,yesterday48,5,1,True,2020-02-22

I don't even know if I have OCD or I'm just like this,"I mean, I'm spending every waking moment reliving the same gruesome thoughts, every second of my life spent in this god damned hell, but I still don't trust my diagnosis, I don't trust my doctors, or my thoughts. I'm bombarded by ideas of neurodegeneration, like I'm meant to just die off and my attempts to fight this illness are wrong. I'm not SUPPOSED to fight, I'm being told by my brain.

My body and brain have been failing. I have severe hypochondria which is supposedly related to OCD, but I'm just a mess. I want to write a fucking essay (I'm not in school anymore, this is for a post online) but I'm just fucked up in the head. I'm so stuck. The words are too big, I don't know what to say here or what to use there.

I can't tell if I'm legitimately mentally ill or I'm just choosing to think these things. I enjoy being extremely unhappy. But I don't REALLY enjoy it. My back hurts, my body hurts, my head hurts, but is that just me being a piece of shit or is that a disease, slowly breaking every structure in my body. I don't want to die but I want my brain back. I wish I could write again without it being this fucking chaos. Am I losing my brain?

As you can see, I can't even organize a paragraph. My insight into my own illness is so low I have psychotic symptoms. But I don't have severe compulsions. The compulsions are tiny, like thoughts about locking doors and disinfecting my bed and not being able to wear new or different clothes/fabrics, those are barely even compulsions. I'm a perfectly healthy piece of shit attention-seeking person and at the same time severely ill and I don't think I will ever know which. But I can't be attention seeking if I don't seek attention? How would I even know if I am trying to seek attention?

I think this has gotten so bad I can no longer follow my own thoughts. I just want to sit here and do nothing until I die. I'm going to a group, hopefully that will help. I can't manage to get treatment otherwise because I'm too mentally ill according to the therapists who say they're not qualified to help me so they send me on my way with a bottle of pills that make my body feel like it's on fire.",OCD,1582373698,york443,0,1,True,2020-02-22

When I was 20, one day a lot of stuff happened in my head (I would not like to get into the details) and I ended up slapping a female friend. It broke her tooth.

I am 38 year old now. And I feel very guilty about that time I slapped that woman (18 years ago). I was watching some documentary on Netflix which mentioned how dental care in USA is crazy expensive(like maybe thousands and thousands of pounds) . And it brought the guilt back for me. I think the woman I slapped got it fixed for maybe like 50 quid or something or maybe on nhs but I still feel very bad. I'm thinking of trying to get in contact with her and asking if I can give a thousand pounds to her.

It‚Äôs just a way of alleviating my guilt, I guess. Because sometimes when I hear things about dental prices it makes me think that I potentially have kind of stolen thousands and thousands.

Today I‚Äôm extremely triggered. I was at the post office today. Filling out an address label when i hear the words ‚Äúbathroom, throw up, and the runs‚Äù.

Do I have OCD?,"So this post might be long, might not, I guess we will find out. I just would like some advice and insight from people that have OCD.

So I have a lot of obsessive thoughts and compulsions. I can have obsessive thoughts about anything really. For example, I have PTSD from childhood abuse, and I have obsessive thoughts about my triggers and the abuse. If I see little boys I will get triggered because I imagine them being abused like I was. Or I will obsess over timelines. Like if I listen to a song that came out in 1978, I will get obsessive thoughts about how many children have been abused from 1978 to now and I will get triggered. I‚Äôm basically always triggered because of this. Always hyper vigilant. A few days ago I was obsessing over a foster kid that I knew on my street. I know that abuse is rampant in the foster system, and I wanted to protect him if I could do I could not stop thinking about taking him and telling him that he can come to me is anyone touches him in any way physically or sexually. I go to knock on the door if the foster home, and it turns out that he was sent away to a different home and I had no way to contact him. This made me obsess over him being abused by some POS monster that I couldn‚Äôt get to. I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about it. Once again got triggered. In September I had to go see a counsellor for anxiety because I couldn‚Äôt stop obsessing over the future. Over what I wanted to do, over getting a job that I could be independent, about starting a family, about moving out. I am 18 and my mom told me to stop worrying about so much at once and take it slow but I couldn‚Äôt stop. I probably spent hours just doing random research on whatever came to mind from minimum salary needed to support oneself to homelessness. I didn‚Äôt want to think about any of it but I couldn‚Äôt stop. I had multiple panic attacks and was in a constant high of anxiety for weeks. I couldn‚Äôt even eat anything, which if you know me you know that‚Äôs not right. I‚Äôm not fat because I have a high metabolism (I am 185-190), but I eat like there‚Äôs no tomorrow. I also have compulsions. I have an obsession with symmetry. Everything I do or build needs to be symmetrical. If I am making something in minecraft, it needs to be symmetrical as a whole, and the different parts need to be built symmetrically while I am doing it. Like say I am building a rectangle, and I place the blocks left, right, left, right, left, right, then the next rectangle needs to be right, left, etc. It‚Äôs like a fractal if symmetry. It like say I touch a door knob with my left hand, I then need to touch it with my right hand, and if I turn it left I need to also turn it right. This means 4 turns of the door knob every time I get the compulsion. Or say I am sitting down and the arm rest is on my left thigh, the other arm rest must also be on my left thigh. Or the foot rest needs to hav both feet on it touching the same parts of my feet or it just feels off and I can‚Äôt ignore it. If I scratch my left cheek I need to scratch the right cheek. You get he idea. I also cannot walk on cracks, and I will draw imaginary lines on the ground usually where there is some change in the environment (like entering a store aisle), and I have to step over that line. I spend a lot of time looking at the ground to make sure I am not stepping on cracks and so I can draw these imaginary lines. I also need to blink in between passing cars or headlights, and sometimes I have to do it halfway between one and the next.

intimacy issues,"I love my boyfriend a lot but he seems way more comfortable in his body than I am, not to mention his sex drive being higher than mine. I love having sex with him. But OCD poses a few issues with it. I wipe his kisses off extremely often and I feel myself tensing up with spit around my mouth as we kiss. His lips are bigger than mine and yeah it just always ends up with there being spit. My OCD also makes my battle with acne extremely difficult and depressing, which also incorporates the kissing thing. Having stuff on my skin makes me feel like screaming. I can manage my acne but the point is that it's not even a delusion or something illogical to know that the spit will make me break out faster and in higher volumes. Body image is also an issue of mine and this makes sex/certain positions/acts difficult. I want to please him but sometimes my I just can't bc of how I see my body or how I think my body might look. This frustrates him. I just think it's gotten worse/is getting worse bc I didn't really previously notice this level of intensity with these issues. It hurts me when I feel like a bitch for wiping off kisses or he loses his boner bc I can't be spontaneous and get into the position he wants during sex.

My obsessive fear of death is ruining my life and I don't know what to do.,"I was diagnosed with OCD about a year ago. I mostly deal with intrusive and obsessive thoughts. I have a fear of death and it is really starting to hinder my life. Every single day I think about death. I think about me dying, my husband dying, my parents dying, etc. I envision scenarios surrounding how I will die or how my loved ones will die. I turned 24 a few weeks ago and several times on my birthday I cried because another year older means another year closer to death (in my mind). My parents are in their 50s and I constantly think about how they will die eventually.

Whenever I am excited for something, I get constant thoughts that I'm going to die before whatever it is I'm excited for happens. I'm going on vacation in May and I keep thinking how I could die before I get to go. I think about how at any moment, I could die. It is getting to the point where I am afraid to leave my house because I'm constantly reminded that this could be it and I could die in a freak accident. I work from home so I only drive a few times a week but when I do, my mind always goes to how I could get in a car accident and die.

I'm afraid of the unknown surrounding death. I don't believe in an afterlife and mostly think it is just nothingness once we die and that terrifies me. I know that it will be like before I was born and I won't know I'm dead but that thought doesn't comfort me. I'd rather have not been born at all because my life is just a constant worry about how eventually it'll all end for me. I know I should make the most of my life now but I'm afraid to do anything because I'm afraid I'll die doing whatever it is I do.

I really want children but I'm afraid to get pregnant because I'm afraid I'll die during childbirth. I'm afraid that if I do have kids and live through childbirth, that I'll have a kid who is mentally unwell and murders me. I cry every night and sometimes throughout the day because I start thinking of death and it overwhelms me to the point of a panic attack (most times).

I'm in therapy but I just feel like I'm getting worse. I've always been afraid of death, even as a little kid, but it was never this bad. I feel like if I continue down this path, a year from now I won't even be able to leave my house and I don't know what to do. I have thoughts like ""If I lie down on a train track and let it run over both my legs, that means I will have suffered enough in life and will then be able to live a happy and worry-free life."" I know thoughts like these are irrational and untrue but they happen constantly.

I'm not sure why I'm even posting here. I have supportive people in my life but no one understands so their advice usually isn't very helpful for my fears. I just want to stop thinking about death all the time. I want to be able to live worry-free and enjoy the time I do have on Earth. I want to be able to start a family with my husband and live a fulfilling life. Does anyone who also has similar obsessive thoughts have any tips that helped them?",OCD,1582405907,autumntumn,8,1,True,2020-02-22
False confession/confession urges,"My memory didn‚Äôt matter, the facts didn‚Äôt matter.
I was being accused of having done something which I had been obsessed for a while with the idea that I might (plausible but didn‚Äôt -&gt; could -&gt; must have) have done. I hadn‚Äôt done the thing. But my brain dismissed all the evidence that I hadn‚Äôt and talk everything it could find that could suggest that I might be the type of PERSON to have done the thing, and maybe so and so person is behaving this way because I DID do the thing, etc. I ruminated about it for months, terrifying myself, and had just started to get over it and leave the thought spiral alone when I was hit with this in your face accusation. I immediately got incredible confession urges and it wasn‚Äôt long til I did it. It was almost like I was putting it out there to test how I felt and whether it felt true or seemed right to say it.
I took it back shortly afterwards (could‚Äôve been the same day or maybe the next, maybe even a week, I can‚Äôt remember- I was trying to work out wtf to say to take it back attempt to explain myself without making it worse).
I‚Äôm sure I looked crazy. Of course now I worry what anyone and everyone would think if they knew what I‚Äôd said, how could they understand, what were they supposed to believe? Even I can barely understand how I got to the point where I just needed to find someone to say that to.

If anyone else has had an experience like this it would be really helpful to hear. I‚Äôve found one YouTube video talking about false memories (obsessing over them so much you start to doubt them until some part of you is convinced- like whether you locked your front door) and about confession urges, which I get all the time.",OCD,1582408029,OCDruiningmylife,5,1,True,2020-02-22

A cautious book recommendation: Marcus Aurelius' Meditations,"First a warning: I'm not suggesting for one second ""Just read this book and you will be cured"". Certainly it didn't for me. But it has been so impactful for me I just have to share it in the hope it will do the same for others.

Reading Meditations has been an absolute revolution for me. I genuinely think reading it has been one of the most important things I've ever done.

The most significant thing it has helped with is the obsession of death/existence. This is a key theme in Meditations. But it has also helped massively for OCD in general. I find myself quoting Marcus in my head to resist the obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviours.

One in particular that I think about a lot (there are so many I could choose from):

""Four habits of thought to watch for, and erase from your mind when you catch them. Tell yourself:

 - This thought is unnecessary.
 - This one is destructive to the people around you.
 - This wouldn't be what you really think (to say what you don't think - the definition of absurdity).

And the fourth reason for self-reproach: that the more divine part of you has been beaten and subdued by the degraded mortal part - the body and its stupid self-indulgence.""

Like I said, it might not help everyone but it has been such a massive help for me that I feel it would be irresponsible not to share it.

I have the Gregory Hays translation, in case you were wondering about that.

Rant about my life and entertainment.,"My OCD has been a mess since 2012 and the most life-ruining element involves entertainment: TV and movies. It's split into a few categories: spoilers, missing details on a first watch, or missing important plot or character elements or details.  
  
Lots of people miss things the first time, and spoilers are bound to happen as well. But dear lord, I cannot stop my brain. I will imagine scenes over and over and imagine what they would be like if I didn't miss a detail or if something wasn't spoiled. I even replay scenes watch them many times, currently about 2 hours with my  recent issue. I also have an issue where I can't remember specifically what I was thinking when I first watched, and if I caught a detail. Normally, people would think, ""wow what a cool detail, I am glad I know this now"" and not, ""oh my god this entire show is ruined because I missed a cool musical detail in the opening and now I am miserable and have no idea what I was thinking at the time and I cannot think about anything else except this because I care so much about this show""
  
It's such a stupid thing to focus on, and I know that as I get older I am going to regret how much time I wasted on these things. I tried therapy but didn't have the money and time to stick with it since of course the therapists nearby don't take my insurance. I'm not really looking for advice I guess, just venting. I've never read about people where their OCD and thoughts focus on this element of media, so I figured I'd share.",OCD,1582410326,RayzTheRoof,6,1,True,2020-02-22
pet sitting an unspayed cat who is now in heat,"hi guys! I legitimately don't know where else to post this. I'm not doing great right now. a friend of my SO asked to have us take care of her cat because she was about to be homeless. I found out last week she hasn't been spayed, because she just went into heat.

I'm doing a lot better with the illness these days because I finally started getting medicated for depression and anxiety two years ago, but one of my biggest triggers is still cat pee. because she's in heat, new cat is leaving spots everywhere and one of my original cats is following suit.

I'm starting to get noseblind to it but I'm almost convinced that my house will never smell good again. I feel like all of the surfaces in the apartment are contaminated somehow, and that nothing will ever be clean again. I got a blacklight and it's lighting up things that don't even smell.

Starting to notice a pattern.,"I‚Äôve had what seems to be the symptoms of OCD and I‚Äôm now starting to realize a pattern regarding the manifestations of my obsessions and intrusive thoughts that‚Äôs oddly helping me start to mitigate my OCD tendencies as my co diction has become more predictable. It‚Äôs in 4 stages.

Stage 1 - The Introduction of the Intrusive Thought
-the thought first occurs to me
-starts with a calm ‚ÄúWhat if?‚Äù question, which moves into the next stage.

Stage 2 - The Panic Stage
-I‚Äôve overthought my ‚ÄúWhat if?‚Äù Question and suddenly, the intrusive thought goes from being no more than a thought to being a legitimate perceived threat.
-this is the most exhausting and torturous part of the process

Stage 3 - The Battle Ensues
-the intrusive thought advanced into my head like wildfire in stage 2, but now the logical side of my brain that tells the truth about how my worries aren‚Äôt worth worrying about acts as a counter force to the intrusive thoughts. 
-This could last for minutes, hours, even days. 

Stage 4 - Intrusive Thought Decay
-this is the point of which I have accepted my doubts against the intrusive thought/s and they have lost their power
-they may come back and bug me but it won‚Äôt be as extreme
-a new intrusive thoughts might take over but it will be over something entirely different.

Same cycle, every time. How is this helping me mitigate my condition? I assume every battle with intrusive thoughts yield the same outcome. You all should try to look at it that way as well.",OCD,1579386434,Pythagorean17,2,1,True,2020-01-18

Anxiety or OCD,Hey everyone I need some help. My dad died about 5 years ago. He was 60 years old. My health started to decline about a year after he passed. I was constantly worried about death and dying. I finally got diagnosed with Hashimotos thyroid disease. It was not to the point where they wanted to put me on medicine though. Fast forward to present day. I no longer worry about dying. I mean I think about it probably more than is healthy but I don‚Äôt obsess over it. The thing I obsess over now is my wife cheating on me. It‚Äôs a constant worry and if she does anything out of the ordinary or goes anywhere by herself I automatically assume she is cheating. This has gotten to the point where i am almost getting physically ill. This has been going on for a year. I finally told her about it and she was very supportive and wants me to seek help and swears there is nothing going on. My worry has been fueled by the fact that out sex life has been zero for a year. Our third child was born in October and she had terrible morning sickness and also has chronic pain and insomnia. She says she is just not interested in sex but she is not cheating on me. She also takes 150mg of Zoloft which I know can affect libido. I told her I believed her but i still have intrusive thoughts about her cheating. I know this must be hurtful to her but I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it no matter what I do. Is this anxiety or OCD?

justification,"so my favorite mixtape was taken off soundcloud.

 I have no way of listening to it besides youtube which I hate because then I can‚Äôt turn my phone off and I use a shit ton of data. 

I began youtube to mp3ing the songs and then putting them into my google drive and finally downloading onto my iphones files. 

then the thought occurred to me that maybe just MAYBE the quality will suffer after having the songs transferred from place to place (youtube to youtube to mp3 to google drive to my files and then finally my ears). 

what the fuck I cannot be listening to music that MIGHT be slightly less quality than what I‚Äôm used to, even if I don‚Äôt notice the difference. 

even if the music has NOT lost any quality it MIGHT have and therefore I wouldn‚Äôt be able to fully enjoy the songs because my mind would be occupied with the fact that I‚Äôm possibly listening to lower quality music!

but since this is a mix tape... perhaps it‚Äôs okay that the quality isn‚Äôt perfect, you know? since it was never released on any major music platform and the only way to actually get a hold of the songs now is to find reuploads on youtube/soundcloud... maybe that‚Äôs part of the beauty of the songs?

 the fact that a perfect version was never really released in the first place and we‚Äôre all listening to some passed on version of the songs anyway makes the music more beautiful?

ocd and spirituality???,"Hi guys :) I have been diagnosed with ocd for quite a while now and although i logically know my intrusive thoughts aren't realistic/real, i still almost always give into my compulsions. One of my reasons for this being that i am a slightly spiritual person (as in i believe in astrology and kind of believe in manifestation), and how can i know for sure that my intrusive thoughts wont come true when i do believe in manifestation? Like if i can make stuff happen just by thinking really hard about it, then wouldn't the same be able to happen with my intrusive thoughts if i didn't give into my compulsions? Especially confusing is that at therapy i always get told to consider the facts and be very logical so how can that exist besides spirituality?

"Fear of poverty, substance abuse, and those society dubs as ""lost"".","This is something I'm working on with my therapist, but can't seem to find answers for. My therapist is NOT an OCD therapist. I'm looking here to see if anyone else is experiencing obsessions like this and whether or not they have found coping tools to deal with it. I feel a lot of confusion because this is a deep rooted fear I have no idea how to face or come to peace with. 

I have very potent fear of becoming addicted to drugs and ruining my life, being mentally ill and ruining my life, and being stuck in perpetual poverty because of mental illness or substance abuse.

I am presently in school, I know what I want to do with my life and its just a matter of getting through it. However I am haunted by these fears and feel like at any moment I could go crazy (fear of psychosis or schizophrenia) or that if I even drink a sip of alcohol Ill become an alcoholic and ruin my life. As a result I avoid places with high numbers of homeless people, I have panic attacks around people who drink too much or use drugs recreationally, and I go into extremely fearful states when I am exposed to drug addicts or the untreated mentally ill.  The images of them haunt me and I spend hours avoiding the spiral of thoughts that I am just like them. That that is my ""destiny"". 

I am also hyper aware of how insensitive and judgmental this is of people experiencing addiction and suffering from homelessness or mental illness. It dehumanizes them by fearing being dehumanized myself. Which is extremely painful. I consciously know these people are all individuals, with different circumstances, but every interaction becomes a way of ""proving"" I am or am not just like them.

I do come from a family with a history of addiction and I've watched people kill themselves slowly with substances. My mom, while emotionally abusive, gave my siblings and I the upper hand by alienating that part of my family and creating an ""otherness"" to them. She herself was never an addict, and worked her ass off to give us a fighting chance in life, literally pulling us from poverty into middle class. However I still feel this deep fear that I will end up like my father, uncle, or aunt. Isolated, addicted, homeless, selfish, cowardly escaping the responsibilities of life because of fear of inadequacy. I live with the ever enduring fear that no matter how hard I work, my brain will somehow ""snap"" and make me like them. 

My first experience of OCD felt much like that. One day I was doing an internship at USC, starting my career and the next (after one toke of a blunt) I was utterly terrified of my own thoughts, taking a break from school to work on therapy and make money to live. I am now in a place where I am finishing school and doing internships again, but I am utterly terrified my brain will ""break"" again.

This is where the obsessions come in. I am constantly seeking reassurance from my therapist and psychiatrist that I am not ""psychotic"" or schizophrenic. As stated above I avoid certain places, which in Los Angeles is close to impossible and makes things very difficult. I avoid addictive substances obsessively. I don't drink caffeine after 3pm, avoid sugars and aspartame, only drinking stevia/erithrytol, avoid fast food, take no pain killers at all, and avoid ALL recreational drugs (in a family that uses medicinal marijuana it's hard. I love them and know how much it helps them, but I perpetually see myself as being ""different"" and fear that if I even breath it in I'll go crazy). 

Going to the DMV, doctors office, or getting gas becomes traumatic and exhausting. If I am around anyone who is clearly addicted to opiates, alcohol, or is exhibiting psychotic symptoms, I immediately believe I am just like them and thus I need to move from them before my destiny ""takes hold"" and I ruin everything going well in my life. 

The added layer is the fear of self-fulfilled prophecy that because I fear and feel it so much, it's coming for me.

I should mention that I do not have a history of schizophrenia in my family. We do have double doses of depression and anxiety though. Hence the addiction, as many of my ancestors coped with pain by using drugs, alcohol, codependency, and abuse. 

I am hyper aware of this and abuse no substances, but I can tell I use school, chores, finances, and errands to cope and avoid thinking about these fears. As soon as I am faced with them. I'm in a flurry of anxiety and fear, like its just outside the door. My life as an addict and schizophrenic is moments away from starting.

Has anyone experienced this in their lives? How do you overcome it? How can I prevent such thoughts from haunting me or preventing me from living a normal life? How can I humanize sufferers of addiction and psychotic disorders instead of making them ghosts of a future that hasn't happened yet.

So... Cannabis and OCD? Will it help or will it hurt?,"I‚Äôm not sure if this could stir controversy as I know the view on cannabis can depend on the individual. Personally, I think marijuana is a great way to detach. 

so I‚Äôm on 10mg of Prozac started taking it two months ago and I must say I feel much better in comparison to where I was when I started feeling the OCD, so my whole life I‚Äôve never had anxiety issues apart from some general anxiousness and nerves in relation to normal situations, but when it became noticeably different was after my grandfather died, suddenly I‚Äôm questioning everything my relationship, my actions, thinking how I‚Äôm an unredeemable bas person. &amp; the funny thing about this whole situation is I‚Äôm nihilistic, I have a firm belief in the concept of nihilism (optimistic nihilism) and always have. (I was originally born to a Christian family but that‚Äôs another story) so I‚Äôve always seen things as ‚Äúdone and dusted‚Äù so to speak that the past is unchanging and the future is unlikely the only thing we know is that we‚Äôre born and we will die. BUT suddenly I‚Äôm freaking out about what I‚Äôm going to do, who I‚Äôm going to be, when I‚Äôm going to be it, how I‚Äôm too sexual, how I‚Äôm a bad person, how I don‚Äôt deserve my partner.
All these sudden terrifying thoughts which were inescapable. I used to enjoy the odd joint but couldn‚Äôt touch it once this began, but after starting Prozac and feeling great I decided to try weed again and it‚Äôs absolutely amazing I‚Äôm relaxed detached and can feel the anxiety but can easily detach and allow it to be there but almost as if it is not because I‚Äôm so detached, very hard to explain.

I practically raised my niece, and I spend a lot of time with her sisters. (Ages 2,6 and 10.)  

She said ""Buttons123, the fact that these thoughts disturb you should give you the clarity of knowing that that *isnt* you. The fact that you've spent countless hours with those kids *alone*. Should make it clear to you, that if you really wanted to harm a child, you would have done it already. Buttons123, I raised you. I've seen your OCD develop and I'm telling you that this is all that it is. Its OCD. It's because that act disturbs you so much that your mind wants to continue disturbing you with them.

Regarding numbers,"So I have some pretty bad compulsions about numbers. And I tend to bind them to whatever obsession I have. I‚Äôm wondering whether someone else has this and has experience doing ERP to treat it. What I havent understood nor had clearly explained by my therapist is exactly how do it right.

When I was younger I would just do the numbers I liked and that was all fine really, like place something a certain number of times or turn the switches off a certain number of times.

Then three years ago my OCD got a lot worse, prtially because I noticed the original behaviour becoming more pervasive, perhaps I was also counting and doing more daily things x number of times.

At that point, not only did I start to obsess about why I was doing this more and how, but I tried fervently to figure out how to stop it. Meanwhile unfortunately seeing it escalate from one thing to the next, spreading like wildfire with me pouring oil on it by obsesing about it.

Now three years later I find I‚Äôm still hooked on numbers, and my original ‚Äùfavourite numbers‚Äù are all cursed by how my OCD turned them bad (‚Äùwhat if the good number is actually ‚Äùbad‚Äù!?‚Äù haha). I want to try to move on from them, but I realise I still use them as the coping mechanism compulsions can be, doing something x amount of times cause the first time ‚Äùit just didnt feel right‚Äù.


My questions are:
How do I stop using the numbers like this?
Do I try to use different numbers, as I have in the past, or do I always only do something the x amount of times that make me feel uncomfortable, and just progressively try to control my response?

(i learned this from therapy, and also years of dealing with wild thoughts. medication probably helped too lmao.) but this pocd really just seems like it‚Äôs being repressed or something, and it‚Äôs really worrying that it isn‚Äôt accompanied by intrusive thoughts like an obsession would normally be, that it‚Äôs just me constantly checking with images if i‚Äôm attracted to children or not, constantly throughout the day, and usually with this horrible anxiety. it just feels like as each day goes by the less and less it feels like ocd and the more real it feels. i feel as if i‚Äôve lost my regular sexuality and it‚Äôs been replaced by whatever the fuck this is. my head is just plagued with these thoughts and i check my attraction over and over again with no conclusion, and again it really scares me that no intrusive thoughts are accompanying this, it‚Äôs purely just compulsive checking and whatnot, and that really fucking freaks me out and i just really need someone to help me get some clarity on this. it feels so fucking real. even as i‚Äôm typing i just checked. i‚Äôm seriously about to give up, i have so many aspirations and things i wanna do but this is really holding me back and making me so miserable. please, someone help me",OCD,1579414095,Upset-Ball,2,1,True,2020-01-19

I cant remember and that makes me worried," I was starting to act like a normal person til I accidentally did not obey a certain compulsion. I do not remember what thoughts without my will to God created this compulsion but I remember, I think, trying to make me remember it, in order not to break the compulsion in the future. I accidentally did what my compulsion was telling me not to do.

  ocd is making hypothesis and is telling me 

ocd: maybe the reason you were maybe trying to make yourself to remember the compulsion, was because they are chances that the thoughts without your will that created the compulsion, were really thoughts with your will, for a second, so it is was no longer a compulsion but maybe a real promise to God.

  I do not remember how strong or scary the thoughts without my will were or if they were 100% thoughts without my will. it was about not watching a specific dialogue from a youtube video. when the compulsion was created, I closed the video I was watching but for some reason, I was trying to find out which video it was. why I was searching which video it was? I do not remember. I remember saying to myself stuff like ""oh now I have to find the video"" but I do not remember if it was an other compulsion or if I was trying to find the video in order to make sure to remember not to click it in the future.

  I accidentally, saw some seconds of that scene from that video on youtube and I am worried.

  I have told God many times, no matter what, never to accept promises and to protect me from these worries and traps of my ocd.

  I try not even think the word promise and now, I ended up worrying if I made an accidental promise?

  I worried a lot the last 3 months to the point, that  I was overpraying and being so anxious and dizzy from the ocd.

  The last 3 months, there have been many similar cases. Thoughts without my will pop up and created a compulsion that I do not want to obey. at that moment, new thoughts pop up without my will, that are about not to obey the compulsion anymore. and then, I get relieved because I am free to disobey the compulsion and I am getting confused cause I can't confirm if the second thoughts without my will that force me to disobey the compulsion are 100% thoughts without my will. I have told myself many times, if a compulsion is created, to force myself and never allow my mind to make new thoughts without my will that will trap me later. 

   The last 3 months, thoughts without my will pop up and created a compulsion and then, for a second, there is a chance, I allow some new thoughts without my will in my head, that are forcing me to disobey compulsion and somehow this relieves me and later, worries me cause it maybe looks like as if they are not 100% thoughts without my will but I think they are 100% thoughts without my will.

  what if the same thing happened about the video compulsion? I do not remember. why I ended up trying to find the video? maybe in order to make sure I wont watch it in the future? maybe that means the thoughts without my will were very scary?

  I cant believe and I cant understand that I always fall in the same trap of my ocd, the last 3 months. I have been telling myself the last 3months, after overanalyzing a compulsion, stuff like ""they were thoughts without my will, I did not make a promise but I will make sure in the next ocd case, not to play its game and not to fall in the same trap"" and in the last 3 months, I fell in the same trap many times and I always end up confused and wondering if the thoughts without my will, for a second, were thoughts with my will.

 the last month, I am having scarier thoughts without my will that are making the compulsions stronger. I was able to fight other compulsions that happened in the last 3 months, because the thoughts without my will that created them were not so strong or so scary. but what if the thoughts without my will that created the video compulsion, were strong and scary? and maybe that is the reason I was making sure to remember the video to avoid clicking it in the future.

  I do not know why I worry so much. I am ill and I have asked God to protect me from these confusing stuff and never to accept promises, no matter what. I am supposed to just say to myself that no matter how strong or scary the thoughts without my will were, that they were just ocd and I should not analyze them but ocd finds a way to bug me like

OCD ruined my laptop's keyboard,"Hi everyone I hope you are well :) 

As the title says because of my obsessive cleaning with wet wipes, some of my keyboard keys stopped working properly. Im not 100% sure that is the reason but most probably some of the liquid messed up the keys...

I have a new fixation,"Hello friends!

The last huge problem I had with OCD was about a year ago and it was death obsessions, probably the most severe and horrible experience of my life. I‚Äôm sure you know how it goes already but it was so horrific I‚Äôm surprised, in hindsight, that I didn‚Äôt kill myself because of it. I don‚Äôt know how to explain how threatening this was. It ruined my romantic relationship at the time, I couldn‚Äôt eat more than a piece of toast or so per day, etc.


So it fizzled out as my fixations usually do but recently I‚Äôve been getting little flits of... catastrophizing ocd? I don‚Äôt know an official name for it but it usually involves death or injury, but it‚Äôs different than death obsessions because something has to trigger it etc. 


Sometimes when I‚Äôm in the car with my mom and or dad I‚Äôll suddenly worry that we‚Äôre going to crash. It usually goes away within a couple minutes and doesn‚Äôt really affect me.


But most recently is yesterday/today. My turtle got a new 90gal tank and this is wonderful.


Except that we needed to call a neighbor to help us lift the tank onto the stand and the whole time this was happening I was downstairs trying to distract myself from intrusive images of the tank falling on them somehow and crushing them to death.


I was able to fill the tank despite this and turtle was very happy. THEN the dogs come upstairs to check it out and my first thought is ‚Äúfuck it‚Äôs gonna topple over on my dogs and kill them‚Äù and simultaneously I‚Äôm getting intrusive images of it happening.


I considered leaving the house to distract myself for a bit and come back fresh but my fear was too great and I couldn‚Äôt.


I sat up there writing the project I‚Äôm working on and continued worrying in various severities and eventually came downstairs to go to bed.


But I couldn‚Äôt sleep or stay asleep. Now I worried it‚Äôd fall through the floorboards and crush me and my turtle would die and my art studio would be ruined.


Now I‚Äôm here still moderately worried and unable to get back to sleep in the early morning.


I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm gonna start worrying about other things too and it‚Äôs gonna destroy my life for awhile.


I guess the point of this post is to hear your experiences with this kind of ocd. 


The worst part of it all is that I can‚Äôt stop worrying even though I know it‚Äôs just my ocd acting up. It makes it all feel so real",OCD,1579435548,_blue_morpho_,0,1,True,2020-01-19

I think I'm going to kill someone,"I don't really know where to talk about this, so I'm putting it here. I'll delete it and repost it somewhere else if this is the wrong place.

I have OCD. A few years ago, it was much worse than it is now. At the present, I've gone through enough therapy that my OCD and I are generally able to coexist in peace. One subtype of OCD I had at the height of my disorder was Harm OCD. It was always the least troublesome aspect of my OCD, though. It controlled my actions only slightly in comparison to other subtypes, like Contamination or Sexual. In fact, now that I've been able to improve my quality of life, I really don't experience any Harm intrusive thoughts, nor do I practice any compulsions around Harm OCD. However, the thought process I've started to experience has begun to trouble me. At first, it was a pleasant fantasy. Now, I fear I will actually do it. I want to know if this is more than OCD. I don't know if I should tell my therapist or psychiatrist. I don't know if I'm actually threatening. And, if I am, I don't want to be hospitalized, again. My most recent hospitalization was highly traumatic. I'm still recovering from it, and it happened almost three years ago. 

Long story short... I want to kill someone.

Not just anyone. Someone very specific. I've hated him for years. We used to be friends, and then he lost a bunch of weight, became popular, and cheated on one of my friends. Though I'm angry that he mistreated one of my closest friends, I'm a very selfish person, so the reason I *hate* him is for a more personal reason. He has been able to maintain his weight loss, obviously due to an eating disorder. Both of us are a similar type of crazy. Similar mood disorders, anxieties, body hatred. I have an eating disorder. Or... used to, I guess. I'm in recovery, and I've been in recovery for a long time. Now, when this ""friend"" rapidly lost a bunch of weight, I was still practicing my ED. I was also rapidly losing weight. He was not a threat. I was ahead of him. But, now, I'm at my natural weight. I check up on all his social media frequently to see if he has regained weight. It's hard to tell in pictures, but I fear that he will become skinnier than me. Or, he probably already is. Almost definitely. His natural weight is quite higher than mine, so, if he regained it all back, he'd be no competition. Even my recovered body would be winning. I could finally move on. But there are people around him urging him to stay skinny. I'd say all his mental health problems are worse than all mine, too. I can't see him ever recovering. Then, mid December 2019, I had a nice thought. 

At first, it was just a fantasy. I realized that the only way to stop him from getting thinner was to kill him. At first, I just thought about meeting up with him again and then bullying him into making himself vomit. Just for a power trip. But, really, that would be more harmful to my ego in the long run. He'd lose even more weight, that way. So, my only option is to get rid of him. 

It's now nearing the end of January. At the beginning of the month, I began seriously thinking about how I would kill him. I now know how I want to kill him. I have access to the things I need to kill him. I know how I will get rid of his body. I just need to plan how to successfully get him to meet me. 

Sometimes, when I get in my head and start imagining killing him in the way I desire, I do get quite nauseous. I think: I can't do that. I can't kill someone. That's bad. That's wrong. I'll likely get caught. I don't want to go to jail for life. However, if there would be no consequences, I would absolutely be able to kill him. 

So, I'm wondering: because I'm having these thoughts of doubt, does that mean that I'm not a threat? I'm finally trying to build a life that I want to live. I don't want to go to jail due to, frankly, a very *stupid, surface-level* reason to kill someone. I don't know if this is just my OCD. I fear that I won't be able to *not* kill him. My harm OCD was never this intense before. I know I'll lose my shit if I ever see him in public. I wouldn't even be able to speak. I'd hurt him physically in any way I'd desire at the time. I like thinking about that, too. I fear that if I don't talk about this with someone, I'll forget the consequences of killing him, and I'll just show up at his apartment and kill him. Again, though: because I'm questioning do it, am I even a threat? Is it just my OCD making me think I'll lose control and kill him? But how wonderful it would be to kill him...

I don't have psychosis. I only have a mood disorder, some anxiety disorders, and, formerly, an eating disorder. I am generally a very passive person. Even if I'm angry with someone, I won't do anything about it. But this guy is different. I want to pull out his oesophagus.

Should I talk about this with my therapist/psychologist? I just don't want her to laugh at me because I'm thinking that I'll probably hurt this person, but it's just my active imagination. I also don't want her to send me to the hospital. That wouldn't work, anyways. Once I'd get out I'd have no choice but to kill him. I'd be able to plan *everything* in that time in the hospital. 

I'm interested to hear opinions on wether this is just OCD or if what I'm saying is problematic in any way. Please don't be rude. Just tell me your opinions.",OCD,1579449809,imfin31,4,1,True,2020-01-19
Recently diagnosed with OCD and totally new to this world. Saying hello and sharing!,"Hi, everyone :)

I am new here and was recently diagnosed with OCD a few days ago. It was a huge ""whoa"" moment for me as I never saw it coming but it all made sense. 

I randomly began explaining to my psychiatrist little things I never really talk about to anyone in my life and as it all flooded out, she was just floored.

Basically, I have a myriad of health issues. I have cystic fibrosis, diabetes, and BPD, but the last 2 diagnoses were not officially diagnosed until recently. Anyway, a few years ago I started experiencing what I thought were symptoms of paranoia. I was convinced in 2016, someone was going to somehow murder me in my highly secured, gated apartment complex. I noticed my bathroom door was closed one night and I didn't remember closing it so I made a neighbor come over and look in every room to make sure there wasn't anyone there to harm me. I brushed this off as ""silly me"".

Moving forward, this paranoia now encompasses other things. I take a LOT of medication and I am always scared they will interact poorly and I will somehow die or OD. When I am left alone, I begin to feel like I'm in a bad acid trip. Everything feels fake and artificial, like I am on a movie set. I begin to spiral into a rabbit hole. My eyes bother me because I can't ""turn them off"", but I'm also afraid that if I close them, I'll somehow keel over. I try to keep myself ""awake"" by watching lighthearted TV or I escape by taking a nap. Feeling my heartbeat scares me. I feel like once I acknowledge that I'm truly alive, I'll die. Certain repetitive noises, like a ticking clock, suffocate me. It fills me with rage. I get sensory overload quite a bit. That's basically the GIST.

As I told my psychiatrist this, she told me this is more ""panic"" than ""paranoia"". She then began explaining OCD to me and it all made so much sense. I guess I never considered myself to have OCD because of my false ideas of what OCD was. Apparently my obsessive thoughts revolve around mainly one concern which is my concern for safety and physical well-being, hence why they are ""obsessive and compulsive"".

Anyway, thank you so much for letting me share. I'm not looking for validation or anything, but if anyone has similar ""ticks?"" (idk what to call them) or simply wants to share their own story, please do so. &lt;3",OCD,1579451744,flowersforbreakfast,1,1,True,2020-01-19
ERP shockingly successful,"So I've finally decided I have enough of my crippling anxiety and doubled down on exposure and response prevention and although I was having pretty severe problems before, it's highly effective at causing obsessions to dissipate. It's a matter of excepting the thoughts as thoughts and refusing to engage with them so they can pass into nothingness. It's difficult at first and will actually temporarily increase anxiety but as you continue to practice it and realize the content of your intrusive thoughts it's irrelevant, it will take effect.

Had a really bad day yesterday,"Yesterday was a bad day for OCD/Depression. I wanted to get my SMOG check done because I have been putting it off and wanted to get it out of the way. I often avoid doing things that involve me going out of the house, I get worried about getting into accidents and I generally just don't like it because I have anxiety when I go out. I really wish I didn't get the check yesterday, I really wish I just let my mom do it for me like she recommended. When I went there, I was told to park on the side of the building and the only space available was a really narrow space in between a nice car and a truck. I didn't know where to park, it was super crowded and nobody was coming out and saying anything to me so I tried to pull into that space. I started to turn to get into the space and then went forward but I didn't gauge how close I was to the car and I hit the back bumper of the nice car. Someone from inside saw me and looked at me incredulously, they yelled ""What the hell!?"" and at that moment I got so scared I could not believe what I just did. The guy whose car it was came up to me and was like ""Dude, what the fuck!?"" and then came up to my window. He was really upset and also some other people from the SMOG place came out. I told him that i'm very sorry and at first he wasn't hearing it, he was like ""Man I JUST posted this car to sell"" and showed me it on his phone. I kept apologizing, I was so fucking scared. I gave him my driver's license and my insurance card and let him take a picture.

The guy at the SMOG place asked me for my papers to do the check and I said ""Let me figure this out first and then i'll do the check"". It was very shady, it seemed like the guy at the SMOG place and this guy whose car I just hit knew each other because they were chatting and looking at me. There was another guy there too they were all chatting and no work was being done on their cars. So after this guy takes a picture of my license and insurance, I ask him for his license. He tells me that he doesn't have to give it to me since the car I hit was part of a dealership he worked for? Nobody was on my side in this so I didn't really push it. Then he started to tell me that usually in situations like this, it's better for me to pay him out of pocket. That way it doesn't go on my record and bump my insurance up. That was red flag number 2, he started to push the idea that I would pay him out of pocket for the damage. He kept telling me that the dealership was going to rack up the price like triple, so it would only make sense for me to do that. I asked him for his license/insurance again and then he said he forgot his wallet. I told him to write down his information and all he gave me was his first name and a phone number. My mom ended up coming down because I told her what happened and she helped me finish the SMOG check and work things out with the guy. He started the whole pay out of pocket stuff on both of us, and she basically told him she thought that was ridiculous. Then she asked the guy working at the place, and he said there was no way it could be what he was saying but he said after they assess the damage maybe it is more worth it to pay the guy out of pocket. Seemed like he was on his side and was possibly helping him convince me to pay out of pocket, anyway I have no proof of that and it's just a theory.

Super sketchy scenario all around,  I was so fucking upset at myself for being so dumb. I wasn't paying attention in the parking lot and I should have just stopped the car before pulling in a space. It's possible this guy doesn't have insurance himself and that's why he didn't give me his info. He took a picture of my license and insurance card, now i'm worried that if he won't get money from his insurance that he will come to my house and come after me and my family. He has my full address, my parents always keep the doors unlocked on habit and get mad at me if I lock them.

Can someone advice me on this new worry,"Weeks ago, I was watching a youtube video and somehow, I was having a compulsion not to watch, I think, a specific dialogue of the scene.

I do not remember how this compulsion was created, probably, because of some random thoughts without my will about a promise to God.

I remember closing the video but for some reason, I started searching in the list. I do not remember why. I remember telling myself stuff like "" now I have to find the video title. I am bored""

it was probably an other compulsion. but I cant remember. I remember finding again the video, clicking it and trying carefully to see if it contains the scene that ocd was not letting me to see. when I carefully, saw the beginning of the scene, I quickly closed it.

Days ago, I accidentally clicked that video and randomly, clicked and saw some seconds from that scene that the compulsion was not allowing me to watch.

I started worrying and closed the video. I tried to calm myself down, that it is just a compulsion and there is no need to worry but ocd, was making hypothesis since I could not remember what thoughts without my will created this compulsion or why after I closed the video, I started trying to find out which one was it.

ocd: maybe you started searching to find which video it was in order to make sure that you wont click it, accidentally, in the future, because the thoughts without your will that created the compulsion were very scary and maybe, they were not 100% thoughts without your will.

I try to remember but I cant find the answers I want. I worry because the last days, the thoughts without my will that create compulsions are scarier than the thoughts without my will that I had 2 months ago.

I also, worry because the last 3 months my thoughts without my will create tiring compulsions that I do not want to do and due to frustration, my organism, makes a suggestion to think new thoughts without my will that will be about not doing the compulsion. as soon as, I hear that suggestion, automatically, these thoughts without my will pop up in my head and I feel relieved cause I feel free not to do what ocd tells me. I do not know if they are 100% without my will. maybe it is like trying to trick ocd by telling it that the new thoughts without my will, that are very scary, do not allow me to do the compulsion, so it should leave me alone.

It is a plan to trick ocd but later, ocd finds a way to create new compulsions according to the thoughts without my will that relieved me.

I do not know if the relieving thoughts are still thoughts without my will or not. many times, I told myself that I should stop using these new thoughts without my will that relieve me, in order to disobey ocd or trick ocd, because I end up worrying much more.

Still almost, 3 months have passed and I am worrying because of these relieving thoughts without my will and I cant confirm if they are without my will or not.

ocd: maybe they are thoughts with your will and you act as if they are thoughts without your will to trick ocd. maybe God accepts these thoughts and makes the promise valid.

I do not remember if something like this, popped up as I was watching the video. but I know thoughts without my will popped up. I just cant remember how strong they were, or how much I thought about them and how much scary they were.

ocd: since you cant remember maybe they were the scariest thoughts without your will and maybe you thought them on purpose to trick ocd and maybe that counted as thoughts with your will. maybe a bad punishment will happen because you maybe meant these thoughts for a second.

I am so worried to even think the word promise and I spend much time, the last 3 months, with praying. I inform God that I do not make promises and no matter what, not to accept promises and to protect me from all these ocd stuff and traps. why I always end up worrying?

I accidentally, saw some seconds of the video and I am worrying cause I do not remember the thoughts without my will and if they were really thoughts without my will. what if the thoughts without my will that created the compulsion, were very bad and scary?

ocd: maybe you meant them for a second, and since you saw some seconds of the video that you were not supposed to see, maybe you will be punished.",OCD,1579459803,Zettoraius,3,1,True,2020-01-19

Please I need you to calm me down,"Weeks ago, I was watching a youtube video and somehow, I was having a compulsion not to watch, I think, a specific dialogue of the scene.

I do not remember how this compulsion was created, probably, because of some random thoughts without my will about a promise to God.

I remember closing the video but for some reason, I started searching in the list. I do not remember why. I remember telling myself stuff like "" now I have to find the video title. I am bored""

it was probably an other compulsion. but I cant remember. I remember finding again the video, clicking it and trying carefully to see if it contains the scene that ocd was not letting me to see. when I carefully, saw the beginning of the scene, I quickly closed it.

Days ago, I accidentally clicked that video and randomly, clicked and saw some seconds from that scene that the compulsion was not allowing me to watch.

I started worrying and closed the video. I tried to calm myself down, that it is just a compulsion and there is no need to worry but ocd, was making hypothesis since I could not remember what thoughts without my will created this compulsion or why after I closed the video, I started trying to find out which one was it.

ocd: maybe you started searching to find which video it was in order to make sure that you wont click it, accidentally, in the future, because the thoughts without your will that created the compulsion were very scary and maybe, they were not 100% thoughts without your will.

I try to remember but I cant find the answers I want. I worry because the last days, the thoughts without my will that create compulsions are scarier than the thoughts without my will that I had 2 months ago.

I also, worry because the last 3 months my thoughts without my will create tiring compulsions that I do not want to do and due to frustration, my organism, makes a suggestion to think new thoughts without my will that will be about not doing the compulsion. as soon as, I hear that suggestion, automatically, these thoughts without my will pop up in my head and I feel relieved cause I feel free not to do what ocd tells me. I do not know if they are 100% without my will. maybe it is like trying to trick ocd by telling it that the new thoughts without my will, that are very scary, do not allow me to do the compulsion, so it should leave me alone.

It is a plan to trick ocd but later, ocd finds a way to create new compulsions according to the thoughts without my will that relieved me.

I do not know if the relieving thoughts are still thoughts without my will or not. many times, I told myself that I should stop using these new thoughts without my will that relieve me, in order to disobey ocd or trick ocd, because I end up worrying much more.

Still almost, 3 months have passed and I am worrying because of these relieving thoughts without my will and I cant confirm if they are without my will or not.

ocd: maybe they are thoughts with your will and you act as if they are thoughts without your will to trick ocd. maybe God accepts these thoughts and makes the promise valid.

I do not remember if something like this, popped up as I was watching the video. but I know thoughts without my will popped up. I just cant remember how strong they were, or how much I thought about them and how much scary they were.

ocd: since you cant remember maybe they were the scariest thoughts without your will and maybe you thought them on purpose to trick ocd and maybe that counted as thoughts with your will. maybe a bad punishment will happen because you maybe meant these thoughts for a second.

I am so worried to even think the word promise and I spend much time, the last 3 months, with praying. I inform God that I do not make promises and no matter what, not to accept promises and to protect me from all these ocd stuff and traps. why I always end up worrying?

I accidentally, saw some seconds of the video and I am worrying cause I do not remember the thoughts without my will and if they were really thoughts without my will. what if the thoughts without my will that created the compulsion, were very bad and scary?

ocd: maybe you meant them for a second, and since you saw some seconds of the video that you were not supposed to see, maybe you will be punished.",OCD,1579471328,Zettoraius,1,1,True,2020-01-19

Advice on what to do?,"Hey everyoneüòÅ

I‚Äôve been a really anxious person since I was about 14 (18 now) and I‚Äôve just started realizing some things about myself. 

I‚Äôm not diagnosed with ocd but lately some of my friends have been pointing some things out to me and It‚Äôs been making me think a lot and I‚Äôve also been doing some research on it.

1. I woke up a few days ago and I looked at my floor and I had pants and a T-shirt beside my bed and I went into a insanely bad mood for 3 days and didn‚Äôt talk to anyone in my family over this (as if they did something) 

2. Art is one of my favorite hobbies and definitely one for life and I wanted to do it in college next year but the thought of me getting so frustrated when painting etc completely turned me off it.

3. I get really into things and people. For example since I like art so much I‚Äôll spend days,weeks or months watching documentaries and constantly thinking about art , talking to everyone and anyone about art and not dressing like myself.  If I start talking to a girl (even if I don‚Äôt like her) I will be thinking about the girl 24/7. I could be standing there or talking to my friend and she will pop into my head and I will start acting what I would act like if she was there.  Another good example is when I was reading this book about the Irish cartel I got seriously seriously obsessed with them. I dressed like them, I had the same mindset as them , I posed the same as they would in pictures and I‚Äôm pretty sure I watched every documentary on YouTube about them and I‚Äôm honestly not over exaggerating about that. It‚Äôs all I used to think about and talk about to my friends until I moved onto the next interest. 

4. Also if someone says something to me in no specific way (it might not be anything bad ) it could be stuck in my head for a few days and it would just repeat over and over again. I remember one particular time when I was 15 I read a facebook comment which wasn‚Äôt anything bad it was just a general comment , but it got stuck in my head and repeated over and over again for about 2 days and it started to frustrate me so much I actually nearly started crying one night . 

5. Colourful clothes seriously piss me off. Like if I left my house in anything other then white, grey or black clothes I won‚Äôt feel myself and feel seriously uncomfortable for the day. 

6. I‚Äôm not sure if this anything got to do with ocd but sometimes I really ,really worry about if I got into a fight with someone because Im fully convinced I‚Äôm capable of not knowing when to stop fighting and might do some serious harm to whoever . 

7. Everything in my room is colour coded and labelled and if my parents come into my room and put my washing away for example it would make me really pissed off aswell

I‚Äôm not looking for reasons to say I have ocd etc, but I‚Äôd like to know if these are some signs of Ocd and should I consider getting myself tested? And if I should get myself tested at my GP how should I say this to my parents ?",OCD,1579476183,fourfortyfourseven,3,1,True,2020-01-19

Hit OCD the hardest...,"Hello everyone,

I have had pretty bad OCD for the past few years now.
I‚Äôm at (and have been) at a stage for a while now where I have to save everything I do, in case in the future I need to know what time something was saved. This is one of the biggest things my OCD puts infront of me, along with lots of other things that just add to the crippling life, that is OCD.
Every time in the past, if I have deleted or done anything that goes against my hoarding, I have to either live with it (which isn‚Äôt really an option if you know and/or have OCD) so instead, I delete all my accounts and start fresh, new email account, I also have to delete all the accounts connected to the old email account, and then delete that too, but I do make backups of these to add to my massive archive of past deleted accounts, incase if in the future I need to have access to the old account information (which I never realistically would, it‚Äôs just part of the hoarding). I have gone through around 40 email accounts and the same amount of accounts that are attached to each email account, I am now at a stage where I can‚Äôt delete my email account and start again because I have an external account on which I can‚Äôt change my email address. So I am in theory stuck to the current email account until the service I use allows me to change the email address on the account...

Just today, this archive of files I have is also bundled with all my lifetime collection of photos that I have saved from years back from when I was younger. I have had these files and never deleted them, even if there are direct duplicates of these, I am not allowed to delete them. So yeah... today was the day I finished encrypting the drive so that if it were to be taken, the files would not be accessible without a Keyfile file. This keyfile serves as the password that the computer can just pick out from the system to unlock the drive so that only the person who should be viewing it can view it.
As well as this, I added a password that I knew personally.
So I had two means of unlocking this drive - password, or keyfile. I assumed that not both at the same time were needed to unlock the drive and I have been using it all day with just the password (but, unknown to me was that the computer was accessing the keyfile file which was on my computer, after I had inputted the password) so I assumed that only the password was necessary cause it didn‚Äôt exactly pop up on my screen showing me that the keyfile was being pulled from the system to unlock the drive also. So, I later on seemed the keyfile to be redundant since I was using my personal password to unlock the drive and that‚Äôs all that it seemed to need to me. So I moved (and here is where it gets bad...) I moved the keyfile to THE ENCRYPTED drive as it was still mounted on my computer and thought nothing more of it, until I unplugged it.... 
later on I plugged it back into the computer, the prompt for my password popped up, I inputted it, I then see a screen telling me that the keyfile has not been located and hence it can‚Äôt be mounted. For anyone who doesn‚Äôt understand this, imagine locking your car keys in your car, and no locksmith can replace this... NONE.

So that‚Äôs my current situation, there are files on there that I have hoarded which I will most likely never have access to again and my ocd is going crazy. Normally in this kind of situation, I would delete all my accounts and wipe my phone and computer and start fresh but I can‚Äôt because I am not able to change the email address on a very important account that I will be using for the foreseeable future...

And the cherry on the cake is that there are genuine childhood memory photos and videos on that drive that I will not be able to get back ever again...

I know people will critisize me for being so stupid but I just need some help with this. I can‚Äôt get over this mental block in my head, I worry so much. There were also files on that drive that I don‚Äôt 100% remember specifically what they were and that is worrying me because my mind is making me think that these are the most important files in the world... it‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt know what they are so my mind is making the worst case scenario and making me believe that these files are like codes for launching nuclear bombs...

If anyone‚Äôs got any advice for me on this I really really really would appreciate it.

Someone made a comment at a gas station tonight that validated my fears,"While paying at a gas station tonight, someone came in and saw my Michigan jacket and said, ""Go blue!"" I turned around and began small talk with him, but my body language was tense. I was feeling very anxious. Our brief chat was normal. He then walked over to the other register where the other clerk was in order to pay, and made a comment out loud so the two clerks and me could hear. This was immediately following him and I talking, bear in mind. He said, ""Guess I'm going to have to start a fight tonight ... starting with the Michigan guy. Should I call the cops now and tell them now or after?"" He was kind of joking, but I'm not certain. Part of me thinks he sensed my tension and anxiety, and that triggered him. I've seen him around town before. He seems like a rough guy (I've seen him around town before. We've never spoken and I don't think he knows me). My obsession centers around people being aggressive with me. I've had many incidents in the past two years of people staring or behaving semi aggressive with me. I obsess over whether I trigger people in the way I think I triggered the man tonight. Part of me wants reassurance over whether a comment like the one he made was joking or whether there was some seriousness to it. I know however how anti recovery reassurance is. Is it at least normal to be this worried about a comment? It isn't just the comment, but that it validates my fears that I trigger people, I'm going to get into a fight eventually, and there's something about my vibes that makes people want to fight me.

Can't stop obsessing over love interests,"Hello all,

So I've had a history of being mistreated in romantic/sexual relationships, so I have a lot of OCD and general anxiety surrounding that area of my life, even when my romantic/sexual relationship is going well.

I had a first date with this guy I met on a dating app and I really really like him. My rational brain knows that it went well and we are going to hang out again soon. We've texted a bit, after the date, and both of us made it clear that it was fun and we want to hang out again. 

The thing is, I'm in between jobs right now and I'm in a new city, so I have wayyyy too much time on my hands. It's impossible for me to get anything done like this. I get 10x more done when I'm super busy and have momentum going. I still go to the gym, hike, etc. regularly but I don't have many friends here to fill up my free days. 

Soooo naturally, my OCD is clinging to this situation. It's only been like 4 days since our date (realistically, a normal amount of time before having another date set up). We talked the first and second day after the date via text, but there are no plans for another date so I'm worrying like crazy that he hates me and isn't interested and doesn't think I'm cool enough. 

We are both in our 20s, he's like 5 years older than me, so definitely more settled in life. He has a really cool, creative job and is basically always working. I'm still trying to figure my life out, working 9-5 marketing jobs while I'm craving doing something more creative. We have a lot of similar tastes and artistic passions, but now my OCD is clinging to ""oh I'm way too far behind him and won't be able to keep up"", even though I'm totally on the right track and I work hard af and will eventually get to a point where I truly love what I do.

Ahhh anyway that's probably unnecessary background.

Losing my shit,"Backstory: schiz-OCD.  No real signs of schizophrenia noticed by anyone, including psychologist. 

So, I was sitting in the dark on my phone, and had this bad feeling of being watched by someone.  The only other time I dealt with that was also dark.  It wasn't that I was being watched by anyone specific; just watched.  I've been so worried that I'm going to start hallucinating that I anticipate seeing shit now.

Once I noticed it, my anxiety blew the fuck up.  Had all kinds of crazy-ass thoughts.  What if the government is watching me (why would they care)?  What if my wife is beaming these feelings into my head (that would be damn impressive, considering she has problems finding files on her phone)?

I'm used to thinking ""what if I become schizophrenic"", but thinking ""what if the government is watching me"" is new.  I'm not used to the intrusive thoughts being so fine-tuned and tangentially related to the fear. 

I'll admit it, I started checking my thoughts.  I know it's bad, but oh well.  I could ask myself ""do I really believe this"", but my brain just kind of stops working, and won't give me an answer.

Finally!,"Just needed to get this out cause I‚Äôve just come from my appointment and I‚Äôm stuck in town for a while waiting for a lift home. 
I was diagnosed unofficially with OCD on the 2nd of January 2020 by my GP. He said I definitely had it but he can‚Äôt give me an official diagnosis. 
It helped a lot at first, knowing that these horrible intrusive thoughts weren‚Äôt me going crazy or being a horrible person but that it‚Äôs a disorder that I am struggling with. 
But then the doubt crept in, as it always does, and told me ‚ÄúWhat if the doctor was wrong? He‚Äôs not actually qualified to diagnose you, he could have been lying to make you feel better, he could‚Äôve said that and then sent a message alerting the government that you are dangerous and can‚Äôt drive, or need to be locked up in an asylum.‚Äù And so the spiral went, on and on and on. 
It looked like it would be a long wait to see a psychiatrist too, but then today something amazing happened. 
There was a cancellation and I got an appointment *today*!!! I know - absolutely crazy good luck! 
He was very kind and listened and he to me that yes, I definitely, without a doubt, do have OCD. The doctor was right, I was right and I‚Äôm not crazy. (He kept reminding me that last part) :) 
I feel a sense of relief definitely, but also can‚Äôt help feeling sad that it‚Äôs now set in stone. 
But the main thing is, now I can actually get on a waiting list for a psychologist and he‚Äôs going to get me to try to do ERP or something (sorry if I got the acronym wrong). And now I know. No more wondering and worrying. Just moving forward and finding ways to deal and keep things at bay.

Things pop up in the corner of my eye while watching videos if I‚Äôm not paying full attention and I have to go back and rewatch, or I‚Äôll get fixated on something - like the way a guy stands up - and have to go back and ‚Äúlearn‚Äù the order of first his hands move, then his face turns, then his knees bend, etc.

However, it‚Äôs not debilitating, at least I don‚Äôt think it is. Technically it‚Äôs not EVERY night that I need to check the door is locked a bunch. And I‚Äôm super forgetful. I‚Äôll be 5-10 minutes late to something because I was checking if I need anything from my room, and it turns out I still did! My ITs about actually harming babies went away about a year ago. My daydreaming dropped from maladaptive to just...way too much still.   Sometimes, I can just say ‚Äúnah whatever‚Äù to the need to rewatch a 2 second clip 10 times. It‚Äôs not all the time. It‚Äôs not the extreme pain people here describe. Some days, I don‚Äôt even worry about it.

I can‚Äôt tell what‚Äôs normal and what‚Äôs concerning. I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm just thinking disturbing thoughts for attention, if I‚Äôm trying to give myself OCD (or other disorders), since I‚Äôve been told that I would be the type to do that (not with OCD specifically). 

Where‚Äôs the line between normal, OCD, and ‚Äúomg I have OCD?‚Äù

Note - I‚Äôm not asking for a diagnosis. This is the Internet. I‚Äôm asking if normal people have little obsessions/compulsions, what the difference is, and if maybe I should seek help (that‚Äôs a longer story, you can ask me in comments or PM why I haven‚Äôt.)",OCD,1579487737,SpinachOnionsandSalt,2,1,True,2020-01-19

Hi all. I‚Äôm getting out of a codependent relationship with my mom but I realized maybe a lot of my romantic relationship OCD stems from my codependent tendencies. Anyone else?,"I always feel guilty not telling my bf my intrusive thoughts which I‚Äôm learning to keep to myself because otherwise it‚Äôs reassurance seeking. Now I tell him when an ocd spike is hitting but I never tell him specifics.

But growing up my mom has shaped/moulded me to be this ‚Äúperfect‚Äù child and I formed a tendency to always confess to her about my ‚Äúmistakes‚Äù, otherwise I would feel so guilty. I always prided myself for making her happy and never showed her my anxious feelings because they would make her upset. Another example is I always feel guilty staying over at my bf‚Äôs for more than a night because my mom might disapprove or because it‚Äôs innately wrong to do that. Or when I get into relationships, I often fear of one day emotionally hurting my partners so I always make sure I absolutely like them on a constant basis so that I‚Äôm not leading them on. It‚Äôs like I ignore my intuition that yes, I like this person enough to date them. And I try to over analyze every feeling and thought so I‚Äôm not hurting them.

Anyways the list goes ON but I‚Äôm in a new relationship now and I have confession tendencies to tell him every relationship intrusive thoughts but this is based from guilt and fear.

My bf got out of a toxic codependent relationship in the past and I fear my ocd might cause me to treat him similar to the way his ex treated him, and many signs showed she had relationship ocd so I‚Äôm even more paranoid because his ex and I had similar mental healths. The difference is I understand my mental health and she would cry over every intrusive thought but it would hurt my bf.

So I‚Äôm wondering if I create boundaries first with my mom, and gain self trust, self love and assertiveness, my confession urges will naturally decrease of go away in my relationship. Instead I can focus on important things like if my partner aligns with my values.

Have you guys ever obsessed over a person?,"I don't mean in the way ""crazy"" people do in movies where they follow them around and take photos of them and stuff. I mean mentally obsess over them.  
  
I've noticed I always have ""a person"". It's typically someone who, unknowingly, gives me a lot of attention. I recognize it's because as a child I received little from my own father, and so finding that in an older male, lots of attention, is satisfying. Anyways, typically they're very kind, supportive, and caring. We'll typically develop a (strictly platonic) relationship, and over time I'll develop feelings for them.  
  
I'll memorize their favorite food, bring them their favorite coffee if I pass a shop on the way to see them, remind them that they're important to me, and think of how life would be if I was with them. By nature however, this is typically an older man, and because of this they are usually married. Here's where my OCD comes in. While this might just seem like a very vivid and intense fantasy, it causes me incredible duress.  
  
I often wish these feelings only ever stood platonic. I typically love the man AND his wife deeply, and would thus never want to hurt them or their marriage. Moreover, I would go as far as to claim, without a doubt, that if the man of my secret affections was to come forward and say ""I've left my wife, I only want you."" I would turn him away. It wouldn't be right. And yet I'm tormented day and night with these thoughts of being with them. Does this happen to anyone else? I know part of it comes from the fact that I don't WANT go think of it, so it becomes harder to avoid. What do I do? I wish it could stay platonic but I can't help my feelings, I just wish they wouldn't always turn so extreme.

My suicidal thoughts are becoming more real,"My therapist and I have successfully managed to decrease my physical compulsions. She‚Äôs happy i‚Äôve made progress but I haven‚Äôt been completely honest with her on how my pure o is much more worse now.

I‚Äôve turned everything inwards, and yeah I may not do my stupid random rituals but I spend HOURS ruminating and worrying and compulsively saying sorry in my head for my intrusive thoughts. 

I feel sick to my stomach that I haven‚Äôt been able to be an open book with my therapist. I‚Äôve been incredibly depressed in general, even without the intrusive thoughts. 

I‚Äôve always had suicidal thoughts but none that i‚Äôd act upon. It was a comforting thought to cope with pain, because I knew that I would never actually go there. 

Lately something different has been happening. I can finally say I know what it truly feels like to have actual depression. I feel like depression is thrown around so easily, I myself would question if I was depressed years ago  (I don‚Äôt think I actually was despite having crazy anxiety) but now there is no doubt that I‚Äôm depressed. Sleeping too much or too little, eating too much or too little, lost interest in nearly everything, isolating myself, and here it is...suicidal thoughts. Real suicidal thoughts. 

It‚Äôs scary because these suicidal ideations are different because I feel like it‚Äôs more of a possibility. I took the time to research how much Benadryl i‚Äôd need to overdose, checked the price, and prepared my money to go buy it. Now it wasn‚Äôt like i‚Äôm going to hurt myself right now but it was more of a safety net to know that it‚Äôs there if I need it. I can‚Äôt believe it. It‚Äôs scary because before I knew I didn‚Äôt have the guts to do it but now it‚Äôs like I care less?

"Constantly confused and guilty, I dont know what's going on","Quick background: I have had OCD for pretty much my whole life, got diagnosed at 16 and got therapy and psychiatry for years and then stopped after I was able to cope healthily and learned exposure therapy techniques. 

So, fast forward 4 years. 

 I went off some antidepressants (not all) and I think my depression started going away. Because I can feel happiness again and have plans for the future and hope and have gotten to the point where I know I will not kill myself no matter what.

And then I had an obsession about me being a narcissist and someone who hurts everyone around me so I started praying constantly for me to be loving and a good person and also at the same time I focused the other half of my attention to my weight and calories and food, because I figured if I was ugly on the inside at least I could be good on the outside? I became utterly obsessed and honestly still am with weight and calories and food. I know I'm using that obsession to stay away from reality. I know I purposefully think thoughts about my weight so that I can focus on that instead of other things.

Ever since this one day about two years ago when I freaked out about being a narcissist, I have been in this weird confusion, I dont feel quite right. I feel like I can't figure out what I am thinking, what I am feeling, and I feel guilty, and very confused all the time. I can't put my finger on it.

I usually just try to refocus my attention to my food obsessions when I start feeling stressed about the above weirdness.. I dont know what's going on. Why am I feeling so strange.. is this even OCD anymore? I feel like I know better now and have gone to therapy and if I struggle it is 100% my fault for not trying to be better. I feel guilty for any happiness because everyone else in the world is struggling and I dont feel like a valid or real person or in the same realm as others if I feel good and like I can't connect anymore, like there's an invisible force stopping me from being with people. and I feel guilty for feeling bad because I think I should know better and like I'm hurting my family and throwing away God's gift or something.

Also, I am a Christian and I believe I will go to heaven when I die. I feel like I shouldn't struggle with anything because I know the truth of my salvation, so why am I still feeling so off? I KNOW things will be okay eventually. But I still feel off. I feel weird. kinda sad. Kinda anxious but like I can't feel it in my body, but it feels like it's there. I feel like my body has numbed itself to bad feelings. I feel a deep inner peace but also I keep thinking about how I want to leave this life and how much I hate living. I can't wait until I die and go to heaven. I find myself thinking, 'im so happy, im doing great, im fine' while also feeling like crying or thinking thoughts about that I wish this life was over already and how I kinda wouldn't mind it if my bulimia ended up killing me early as long as I lived longer than my family so they wouldn't be hurt.

&amp;#x200B;

if anyone can relate and is okay with commenting, please comment and if anyone can tell me if this sounds like ocd or something else please tell me, is this normal for a Christian?? Like when I read Ecclesiastes, I feel like I can relate to the feelings the writer seems to have. so is that good? is it normal? i dont mean you have to comment, i'll be okay if you dont, but if someone is perfectly fine with commenting can someone tell me what they think about all this? thank you so so so much.",OCD,1579509228,obsessivemoose,4,1,True,2020-01-20
Retroactive jealousy is a bitch,"To start I have had OCD all my life or at least as far back as I can remember. I was ""officially"" diagnosed in 2012 but after that I realized that many things I did in the past stems from the OCD. I guess I was only diagnosed because I had a really hard time in 2012 which led to me almost being hospitalized. 

After about 2 months it got better until 2013 when it came back after I went off my medication in late 2012. I was in a real bad place again for a few months. I went back on the medication. I started running and that helped a lot and ultimately I did a few triathlons and ultra running events. (Maybe OCD can be good for something). What's even more amazing is that I did all these events despite one of my triggers being that my heart rate rises.

Slowly but surely I got better. Really better. In about 2017 I went off the medication and I didn't look back. The symptoms got better all the time. In August this year I met a woman and we hit it off. It was amazing. It felt as if we were meant for each other and it still does. Then in October it struck again. With all its vengeance.

And let me tell you it's a MF. It keeps me busy a fair amount of time during the day.  The million thoughts a day about her past. The mental images I see. The doubt. Will I ever be enough? Will I be good enough for her? It's driving me mad. It makes me sad. It makes me angry. That feeling of not being adequate that you can't explain to anyone. It is a living hell. It's not only bad for me, but in the process I've hurt her, I made her sad and it has to stop.

I think I've finally reached breaking point. Now it has to stop. I know my love for her is greater than this thing in my head. If I don't put up a fight I will lose her and that hurts even more.

NEED HELP: Ridiculously catastrophic thoughts THAT NEVER STOP," I have diagnosed ADD. I used to take Ritalin for my ADD but the rebound effects were terrible. I don't like taking pills. I often daydream about being in a world where no one understands me or cares for me or my feelings, laugh at my crying. where terrible things happen to me (forced marriage, beatings, abusive husband, my children not caring for me).

In reality, I'm am not married. I am with a man that deeply cares for me and luckily my family is 100% supportive of my relationship (my fam is cool. they would never force me into anything), but somehow I forget all of this when I daydream.

Does any of what I'm going through sound like Real Event OCD?,"**Disclaimer: This post details an, I would say, *somewhat* strange fetish/kink and some mentioning of passive suicidal ideation**

You can tell from my post history that I've been pretty active within the last couple of months, but this is the first time I've posted in this sub as I'm toying with the idea that Real Event OCD may be a part of a problem I'm having. I have had six sessions of talk therapy and am intending to return to ask about Real Event OCD but I just wanted to hear what you all think first. **And damn this is *long* but I do feel that I need to detail everything and I really, really appreciate any one who can take the time to read and make respond, thank you. Alright, here goes!**

I'm a 21 year old dude and I'm gay. When I was maybe 8 I developed an interest in wedgies. I didn't pay much attention to it then but I started to more at age 12. I would watch wedgie videos on YouTube, read stories about them. I don't ever remember getting hard from these, as I was a bit of a late bloomer, but I could be wrong. 

When I was 13 my cousin stayed with our family for a couple days. While we were hanging out around our pool I snuck up behind him and gave him a wedgie, just tugged a couple times. He laughed in surprise and just kinda rang free. Over the next couple days I would attempt to give him more but I think most of these attempts were just to get him to retaliate and give me one. I would purposely have my waistband exposed and I once even put on three pairs at once and said ""Ha, can't wedgie me now"" or something. If he ever told me to stop I would but still, I feel as though I made him uncomfortable as I was being persistent and my behaviour may have been a bit ""off"". (As far as I know, I'd never behaved this way with him or anyone else before). 

I do have a murky memory of him seeing that I was hard beneath my shorts. I was not trying to expose myself or anything and I don't \*think\* this happened during a wedgie. It could have been unrelated but let's say, for sake of argument that it wasn't unrelated and did happen. After this two day stint of say, 6-8 wedgies/attempted wedgies and the few I got in return, I stopped and my cousin and I never spoke about it again. I don't see him much but in the handful of times we saw each other in the couple of years since that two day visit, we've laughed and joked together, gamed, our relationship has been pretty much normal. 

Then at age 13-14, I asked a cousin of 9 to give me a wedgie in exchange for chocolate or something. As I remember he just laughed and obliged, tugging on my waistband once. He then ran out and told my Mom, not to tell on me, just to get his chocolate. I was in the room and when she looked at me I just walked out, feeling caught. She asked me afterwards about it and I lied. I told her that I said ""I'd give them chocolate if they *stopped* giving me a wedgie"" and my Mum said ""Oh, alright"". 

These two situations happened before I'd ever jerked off, before I realised that what I had was a fetish for wedgies. I was acting on and exploring this obsession I had with them. I do think that with this kink it's understandable that I would explore at a young age as a wedgie is something that kids do. Still, I think deep down I knew it wasn't the right thing to do in my case. I mean, I was guilty when I was told on. I didn't act inappropriately again and around age 14-15 I started to realise that it was a fetish and so I just kept it to myself.

I think it‚Äôs worth mentioning that these aren‚Äôt experiences I revisit fondly or sexually at all. And also: the wedgies weren‚Äôt too forceful, each wedgie would have been one, maybe two tugs.

## Now on to Part 2 of 3 ## ^yeah really

At age 18 I'm exploring the kink online. There's a lot of dudes doing the same on wedgie-related Instagram accounts. I'm chatting with someone who I've message role-played with before and we start another. He asks if I can show my face and at the time I'm too horny, sleepy and directionless in life to care. I say sure. So I consensually act out some wedgie scenarios. There's a couple pictures of me with my underwear sticking out the back of my shorts a bit and a handful of videos of me saying things along the lines of ""Aw I'm such a loser, I get wedgies all the time"". They're all pretty much just acting out a bully scenario where I'm being kinda submissive and embarrassed. There's no nudity at all and no jerking off etc.

I enjoy it during but afterwards I kind of regret it. So I don't contact the dude any more and I don't role-play again. Around six months pass and I'm suddenly scared at the idea of these getting out, or just scared that I did them at all. I contact the dude and ask if he can delete them and he says he's sorry but he can't. Seems as though he enjoys them too much. I press but he maintains that they won't be deleted, though he promises that they will never be shared or posted. Eventually I just say alright and I go to sleep, the next day I don't really think about it at all.

Now, two years after this, something triggers the same fears and I'm scared again. I message him again and he tells me he last told me. This time I keep up chatting with him and I tell him that I'm feeling anxious about it so he gives me his Facebook, Instagram, Twitter. I know his name, age, job, location, all of that. He gives me this so that I can trust him, or just as leverage for keeping the pictures and videos. After a little while he tells me that they've been accidentally deleted. I can't be sure but he's never lied before and I don't know if he really has a reason to. 

This does get me to calm down and so for a few days I'm back to my normal self again. But \*then\* I connect what I did as a 13-14 year old with the online role-play. If those pictures and videos got out and got to my family, not only would it be very embarrassing but would my younger cousins feel abused or something?

I started talk therapy and got this all out on the table and I did feel reassured that my therapist didn't think this was too big of a problem. She gave me some great advice and perspective and okayed my idea to seek advice on Reddit as well. At the end of our sixth and last session (which was close to two months ago) we pretty much landed on ""Those pictures and videos aren't a problem right now, so don't pay them any mind. If they're ever shared, it will be a problem so handle it then. It will be easier to handle as you can gauge the reaction and act accordingly where as right now you're going crazy thinking about what the reaction could be.""

I once said during a session that if I could undo any of the two mistakes (what I did as a kid and the role-play) I'd undo the role-play. And she said because without the role-play, what you did as a kid isn't a problem. And that's something I'm getting caught up on.

Do I really think that what I did as a kid isn't a problem on its own? Maybe. Before the role-play I would very occasionally cringe at the thought of what I did as a kid and I do remember a day or two when I was thinking a lot about it and it made me feel that I was some kind of child abuser. I guess the idea of those pictures and videos gives that idea more fuel as it would be a reminder to my behaviour and would prove that it was something sexual for me. 

My therapist has noted that I wasn't jerking off in the video so to her, it would just appear as some kind of joke, sketch or non-sexual role-play. Others on Reddit have said similar things but I'm not so sure. I \*could\* defend it in this way but I'd feel guilty considering what I did in the past. Out of the two mistakes, I really am mostly just worried about the pictures and videos and think of what I did as a kid as another layer to that problem, though I fear that this way of thinking is a ""not sorry I did it, sorry I got caught"" way of thinking. 

## Part 3 of 3 ## ^sorry

I want to bring attention to why I feel Real Event OCD may be playing a part in all of this. For the last four months (not counting a collective two-three weeks where I felt okay) I've been putting myself through hell over all this. I've been having daydreams about admitting all of this and packing my car and running away, or going to prison, or being homeless by choice or just turning in to a shut-in. Sometimes it's how I put myself to sleep, though over time these thoughts have slowed down. 

I can't seem to be reassured by anything or anyone that what I did as a kid wasn't terrible. The closest I've gotten is ""Maybe not ideal but not worth beating yourself up over"". I do want to stop thinking about all of this as, deep down I really don't think the pictures and videos are going anywhere (and that's if they aren't really deleted) and I know it's not helpful to just keep thinking that it \*could\* happen. But before long I'm struck by the guilt over what I did as a kid, and I begin to feel as though it's my penance to just let this trouble me forever. I also feel that living my life without worry is the same as not admitting to a crime or a wrongdoing.

I have had some passive suicidal ideation, I think that I just got dealt a bad hand with having this fetish and I made mistakes with it. And that maybe I can forgive myself if I also just end everything. I'm scared of what a burden and a shame I'll be to those around me if the pictures or videos get out and so sometimes I do think it's best for me to check out before that can happen. These thoughts are passive and serve maybe as more of an escapist fantasy. I am not in any immediate danger. 

Both my cousins, though we don't see each other much, have a good or at least normal relationship with me. The one who is a year younger recently accepted my follow request and followed me back which made me feel a bit better. And nothing has ever been brought up by them, but then I keep thinking about how sometimes victims take years to come forward or to understand that they were abused and I'm scared that they're troubled by what I did. 

I have developed this strange habit of looking at dates. If I'm on YouTube I'll look at the ten or so recommended videos and look for one that is posted '3 Years Ago' and I'd wish that I could turn back to then, undoing my mistake of the online role-play. I do this with Instagram photos, I scroll back really far on an account and pick a random photo and hope it was posted on a date before the role-play. If not, I scroll more and try again. It's *maybe* like a ritual.

I'm on holidays from studying and work right now so I'm not as busy, which may be affecting how much time I'm spending on this as well. But...it's just a mess. I'm sorry that this is long but thank you so much if you've stuck it out, I know it's a lot. Please tell me what you think if you can. Thank you all again",OCD,1579524947,throwawaymmmg,1,1,True,2020-01-20
OCD or manipulative partner?,"Hey all 

Basically, I‚Äôve had very toxic relationships in the past. For this reason I sometimes find it hard to know if I really deserve blame or if I‚Äôm being manipulated to feel guilty. 

I‚Äôm currently in a relationship that has been affected by my OCD and I take responsibility for that. But I find that my partner often reacts in a way that is way beyond necessary when we have silly fall outs or disagreements, and they use the past and my previous trust / OCD issues to justify the reaction because they‚Äôre still hurt. 

I get that, and I have apologised profusely and I‚Äôm working on improving my behaviour. I feel I‚Äôm doing well. My OCD is currently really under control and I‚Äôm so pleased about that. I know I can‚Äôt rush them forgiving me. 

But I‚Äôm sometimes unsure if I‚Äôm the one acting unacceptably or if it‚Äôs them and they‚Äôre using my past actions against me. It always seems to be me doing everything wrong rather than them taking responsibility for anything. Not even huge issues, just regular relationship stuff. Things they say can be very very nasty and said just to hurt me. They are quite moody with me if I say something ‚Äòwrong‚Äô. They react very defensively to simple questions if they‚Äôre in a bad mood, like ‚Äòare you okay?‚Äô If I‚Äôm feeling they‚Äôre stressed or something. 

I‚Äôm just wondering if anyone else here experiences this basically. It‚Äôs sooooooo difficult to feel positive about my OCD recovery when I constantly feel like I‚Äôm stepping on eggshells around my partner and then questioning whether I‚Äôm even getting better mental health wise because my partner makes me question it, especially considering my past relationship experiences. 

Sorry this is long!!!",OCD,1579526171,pretzelbunnies22,0,1,True,2020-01-20
"Compulsive swallowing, and a lot of suicidal thoughts last week. My OCD is really bothering me to the point where i'm thinking to kill my damn self","I swallow every minute like 3 or 4 time.

Please can someone talk to me,"The last 3 months, I have scary thoughts without my will about promise to God and scary punishments. These thoughts without my will pop up and create compulsions because they forbid me from doing what I want. They tell me to do unnecessary things.

When I am frustrated or tired from these compulsion that I do not want to do, my subconscious suggest me to allow in my head new thoughts without my will about changing the compulsion from ""must do the compulsion"" into ""must not do the compulsion"" and I feel relieved. These new thoughts without my will pop up in a second and they relieve me and then, I maybe act as if they matter, even though I know they are still thoughts without my will. These new thoughts without my will that relieve me, help me not do the compulsion and let me be free without having worries for not doing the compulsion. I tell to my ocd that thanks to the new thoughts without my will, I must not do the compulsion.

Many times, the last 3 months, these new thoughts without my will that relieve me, are accompanied with the word God as if I am speaking to God and maybe it seems like with these thoughts without my will I am making a promise without my will to Him that is about not to do the ocd compulsion. Sometimes, these is, automatically, accompanied with scary thoughts without my will about punishment. It is scary but they relieve me cause I am forced and, somehow, feeling free not to do the compulsion.

A 1-2 seconds, maybe, later, I worry and I am wondering if by feeling relieved and maybe, if I act as if these thoughts without my will matter, if I made an accidental promise without my will to God. I cant understand how I ended up on this. I try not even think the word promise and I end up worrying If I accidentally, made one?

The last 3 months, there have been some similar cases. At first, it was scary because I was having worries like ""what if for a second, these thoughts without my will were not 100% without my will? what if I acted as if they matter? why I felt relieved? I do not know"" and after overanalyzing, I kept reminding myself, no matter how much frustrated or tired I am to do a compulsion, never allow myself to make new thoughts without my will that will relieve me and allow me not to do the compulsion, because it is still ocd and tries to trap me. There is a chance, maybe, for a second, when my subconscious makes a suggestion to allow the new thoughts without my will that relieve me in my head, I, in a second, maybe on purpose but probably not, I allow them and sometimes, they are accompanied with scary thoughts about punishment without my will.

In the last 3 months, after some 3-4 cases of having the new thoughts without my will that relieve me, and after reminding myself, so many times, not to fall in the same trap again, I ended up thinking that they are actually, still thoughts without my will because I try not to fall in the same trap and I always fall. I think this means that they are without my will 100% but I am not sure and I cant confirm it.

Weeks ago, I ended up having a compulsion not watch a dialogue from a scene in a tv episode on youtube. I do not remember how this compulsion was created or what were exactly, the thoughts without my will that created it.

Days ago, I accidentally clicked and saw some seconds from that scene that contained that dialogue and I got so worried cause I remember the compulsion. I remember, weeks ago, after closing the video when the compulsion was created, me searching the tv episode in the list for some reason. maybe because there was another ocd compulsion that was telling me to do that? or maybe the thoughts without my will that created this compulsion, were so scary or strong that I had to make sure to find which episode it was, so I will not click it in the future.

I do not remember. the last days, I am having very scary thoughts without my will and I worry if these very scary thoughts without my will created the compulsion and I worry if at first, the compulsion was ""must watch the dialogue"" and maybe due to frustration, I changed the compulsion from ""must watch the dialogue"" into ""must not watch the dialogue"" cause that means I felt relieved and I cant confirm if the thoughts without my will were 100% without my will.

I have prayed to God many times to tell Him that I do not make promises and I asked Him to protect me and no matter what, not to accept promises. I prayed about my ocd and told Him that ocd tries to trap and that I always end up having new thoughts without my will that relieve me and that it is still ocd and they pop up because I want to be free from the compulsion. I try not to feel relieved or allow these thoughts without my will but I end up having them without my will, probably. I try not to act as if they matter, cause I know they do not matter, but i worry and feel relieved the same time.

About the video, i cant remember how much strong or scary the thoughts without my will were or if they relieved me. I can't confirm if they were 100% thoughts without my will. I worry because ocd is like

Great quote about accepting uncertainty.,"""People going through OCD treatment often make themselves unnecessarily unhappy by interpreting uncertainty acceptance as a mandate to assume the worst and then dwell on it.  Rather than it having to be a net negative experience, it can be a freeing one.  If you assume your fears are untrue and engaging in behaviors that reflect this, while still allowing for the possibility that you are wrong (and hence, necessarily accepting uncertainty), you can allow yourself to enjoy the experience on your own terms.  By letting go of resistance to uncertainty, you free yourself up to act like a person who thinks things will work out fine.  For those with morality-themed obsessions, this means assuming you are good instead of trying to prove it to your OCD.  As long as you leave space for being wrong, you are accepting uncertainty even when you are framing things positively.""

From [this article](https://www.intrusivethoughts.org/blog/mistaken-beliefs-uncertainty-acceptance-ocd/) by Jon Herschfeld. 

I found that when my therapist told me to live with doubt I started feeling like everything was a 50/50 coin toss, which is not necessarily the happiest way to go through life. I think it's good to remember that you can assume the best without having to come up with a million ""rational"" reasons why you're right or wrong, and use positivity as a starting point but not a certainty.",OCD,1579528312,giftit99,10,1,True,2020-01-20

Currently struggling with university,"I'm in my second year of university and have 3 deadlines due in. 2 on Friday and one for next Monday. 


Before Christmas I was recieving CBT counselling through a service the NHS offers for my OCD that somewhat helped but not in the long run. They offered 8 sessions which once completed left me on my own again. 


In some respects it helped me through some ROCD traits but since stopping the sessions, my OCD has changed and compulsions have worsened and so has my dependence on substances. I have trouble sleeping, completing menial tasks, eating properly, waking up and attending university and concentrating on anything even things I normally enjoy.


I deal with a lot of feelings of guilt and shame currently as well as a lot of existential thinking, paranoia regarding my relationship, sexuality, failure and it's making it impossible to get anything done.


As these deadlines are approaching my mental health has been rapidly declining. I want to be able to complete my work but I feel as though I can't and my fear of failing is making it even more difficult to do anything.",OCD,1579534153,Sockvalueinthemorn,0,1,True,2020-01-20
So confused hocd,Sorry if this isn‚Äôt the place to be posting but here i go. Let me get straight to it I‚Äôve heard of hocd and how people have fake arousal and groinal responses and it makes them feel like it‚Äôs real attraction when it‚Äôs not.

It‚Äôs confusing because i will keep looking at shemales to see if I get any kind of response and at first I don‚Äôt but the more i look i feel like eventually i will. Just recently i was looking at one and i got an erection and honestly i just acted on it because i told myself okay maybe I‚Äôm bisexual who cares and i had these butterfly feelings and my mind was telling me you‚Äôre attracted to this and as soon as I started masturbating to it i just couldn‚Äôt idk if it‚Äôs because I think it‚Äôs not right but I don‚Äôt think so because i always try telling myself just accept yourself and try masturbating to this eventually it won‚Äôt even matter but i can‚Äôt it just turns me off completely and i feel stupid because i keep doing this shit and im so fucking sad and mad because im doing this bullshit. As soon as i start watching a nude female shaking her bare butt i can masturbate to it just fine. I have a girlfriend we have a good sex life i know the sexual attraction i feel with her is real. It‚Äôs made me so sad and mad because I keep doing this shit and i feel depressed because I‚Äôm like why I don‚Äôt even like men im not attracted to them. Then my mind keeps telling me just do it again maybe you are attracted to them but you‚Äôre repressing it then i try and no I can‚Äôt.

I am so fed up with this bullshit,"I have that weird OCD that revolves around ""being judged"", it developed when I was in school, for example when I was taking a big exam, reading something in front of a class, talking with people while others were listening, I was anxious I was being judged.

1) I am in a good mood, talk to someone, present something in front of a group

2) A thought pops up ""what if I fuck something up, what if THAT state of depersonalisation starts again (caused by anxiety itself!!!)

3) I shit my pants ""holy fuck this CANNOT happen right now because Im in the middle of a presentation.

I can't eat, well i've been surviving mainly on prepackaged chocolates, biscuits and pasta which I deemed ""safe"" as they were mass produced in a factory. But I don't enjoy eating anymore, and that used to be my favourite hobby (i'm fat haha :D). I've lost over 10kg, not because I was even trying to lose weight, I mean hey i'm not complaining, probably the only silver lining of this madness. 

But my OCD has gotten to a point where I can't even urinate without taking a shower right after and so I don't drink much water during the day. I haven't eaten a single vegetable or fruit because all I see is hepatitis everywhere. The skin on my hands are broken and I have cuts everywhere, which is making it even worse as viruses and bacteria can more easily enter. 

I rarely brush my teeth, because i think my toothbrush is contaminated, I think i've purchase and used over 10 toothbrushes in the span of these 3-4 months. I can't look at people when they are talking because of spitters, and I'm constantly wiping my lips with a baby wipe, there's literally a 3 foot mountain of used tissues and baby wipes in my room right now. I'm going to the gynecologist tomorrow and i'm absolutely terrified of catching something, i mean what if the equipment used wasn't sterile. This life isn't sustainable, i'm going fucking mental. My life is controlled by rituals that make no fucking sense, no matter how much I try to rationalize my fears, i just can't stop myself. 

I just want my old shitty life back, where at least I could drown my sorrows is sweet, delicious things.",OCD,1579559087,badkitty93,5,1,True,2020-01-20
Common Ocd Symptoms no one talks about,"I wanted to list some common symptoms that are  rarely discussed. My friend who also has severe ocd and I noticed we experienced a lot of these things and I talked to my therapist and she said these are common and even normal for people with ocd. Feel free to add more and talk about your experiences with these in the comments!

-sleep issues (typically hypersomnia due to higher brain activity during the day)

Avoiding the Solution,"I‚Äôve been a part of this community for a short time now, and there‚Äôs a pattern I‚Äôve noticed. 

Sure, seeking reassurance is a compulsion, and no one would fault you for that. It seems to be part of the sub rules that you can‚Äôt seek reassurance, but most posts have this exact content. I‚Äôm not pro-censorship, but I do believe more people are legitimately harmed by allowing it to occur so prevalently.

Truth is, OCD is a chronic condition that can wax and wane over time. There could be times of more severe obsessing and compulsing. You may experience a full recovery.

ERP/CBT are the gold standards of treatment. It is amongst the most effective forms of treatment in the entire field of mental health therapies. There‚Äôs also promising results from medication therapies. In severe cases people have tried deep brain stimulation. Those are your options. No amount of reasoning, debating, or ruminating will get you out of the cycle. In fact, it‚Äôs making your obsessions worse.

Everyone responds to treatment differently. I went through dozens of therapists and spent more than 15 years in the professional mental health treatment sphere before finding ERP. I failed way more than I succeeded. Yet, I did find something that worked. 

I‚Äôve been there, we‚Äôve all been there, but when you‚Äôre participating in this sub just reflect if you‚Äôre actually helping someone by providing reassurance. When you‚Äôre giving a rational analysis of an obsession, is that helping them or just validating that the obsession is worth taking seriously?

"Guilt about event that happened when I was 13 - I still don't know how to process it, 17 years later. I feel like scum. What do I do?","When I was 13, I was a desperate and kissless (female) virgin and decided to try to kiss my then two year old niece - just to see what kissing was like.   
I put a piece of candy between my teeth and urged her to take it with her mouth. She didn't understand what I tried to do, nothing happened and I didn't push the matter further.   


I didn't think about it for a good while, then - a few years later - it dawned on me what had almost happened. I had almost kissed a toddler. I, a 13 year old girl who should have known better, tried to kiss a small child. Oh. My God. My mouth and even tongue could have ABUSED a child.   
When I realized this, a guilt-based OCD emerged that I haven't been able to rid myself of. I'm 30 now, and this has gone away, then re-emerged throughout my life. I have talked about it to friends and some partners and nobody has ever reacted badly. Some have even confessed similar stories (and I haven't thought *they* were dirty and disgusting, like I think I am). The OCD usually re-emerges when I enter a new relationship, especially if it's going well - like now. I think I've met the man of my dreams, yet my OCD keeps telling me I am a disgusting piece of human garbage, and that if he knew about this he'd leave instantly. He wouldn't let be be around children. He would think as badly of me as I do myself. So I keep it to myself, and it's killing me. When he looks at me and smiles, I keep thinking I'm tricking him into liking me, as I am, actually, a monster.  


I don't know what to do about this. I know, logically, that what I did was an act of desperation as a young teen, and that I didn't have ill intent. Plus, nothing actually happened, since my niece didn't comply or understand. It doesn't help my OCD, though. It knows what almost happened. It knows I decided to abuse my own flesh and blood for the sake of ""being kissed"". I hate myself.",OCD,1579563700,ClusterBust,1,1,True,2020-01-20

I make my obsessions and intrusive thoughts ridiculous.,"So I have harm ocd (pure o), used to have health related ocd and sometimes my fear of going crazy or getting a new mental illness shows up to. But one of the most helpful things I do now in my recovery is re-inforce what I was told in therapy and making the thoughts even more unbelievable. Much like the scene in Harry potter... with the spider and rollerskates. 

Today I had an intrusive thought about being an angry person that goes all psycho on someone at the drop of a hat. I hurt someone, everyone hates me, I end up locked up for life. The end. you know the drill. But instead of obsessing and reacting to the inevitable anxiety that followed I invented a more crazy scenario that had the same implications but did not arouse fear. 

I'm now sexually attracted to furnishings, particularly useful ones like shelves and drawers. I molest shelves in a cafe with family and friends watching, they are disgusted. I never live it down and continue my rampage whenever a slim well mounted shelf is spotted. I am locked away and have no friends. The end. 

I giggle at the thought. And the moral is... Because I thought of something I would never do, does not mean it will happen. Ocd feeds on your uncertainty about a thought being 'wrong' and like a bruise will only hurt more if you poke it. So now I let the thought be, and if I get anxious I distract myself with a silly story until the anxiety fades. The thought is not a problem, the obsessing and ruminating after is what makes your anxiety go up and up. And anxiety makes it easier to have unwanted thoughts because your brain is actively thinking about what scares you. You gotta get creative friends. 

Thought fusion is so so horrible. It's not easy and I was in therapy for a long time before I could be so light hearted. I hope this tale cheered you up. I'm a year free from any major panic attack and live a mostly ocd free life.",OCD,1579568820,quietwreck,1,1,True,2020-01-20

[POCD] Terrified of being a P! Don't know what to do.,"So basically I have been struggling with POCD for over 2 years (currently 23, starting getting this when I was 20/21 can't exactly remember), it came about basically as soon as my racist OCD ended (racial slurs and racist thoughts whenever I saw a ethnic minority, ended when my new work colleague was British African and we got on super well). 

I got all the trademarks of POCD, intrusive thoughts and genital tingling (not a good feeling, made me want to cut my dick off), I had thought I had no attraction to children and these thoughts and feelings caused me massive distress to the point I spent months with a councillor trying to figure this out (only to get to the point where they said they had no idea). I feel into deeper and deeper depression and wanted to end it all as I genuinely believed I was a pedo and was constantly jacking off to get rid of any 'urges'/try not to look at or interact with any children, that was until I discovered an OCD sufferers website with a guy saying he was experiencing the same thing and he also felt like a monster. 

That was a massive relief and it explained alot of my mental health issues in the past: I would have periods where I would get an idea into my head and be terrified of it happening, like having a stroke, or a brain tumor or the previously mentioned racism and I'd have to go checking for symptoms constantly but physically and mentally. Typically these 'episodes' would last several months and afterwards I would be ok for a few months before my mind latched onto its next fear, I had never made the connection between any of these before (I viewed each episode as a source of embarrassment and didn't like to think about them).

So back in Aug I saw my GP and gave then a quick rundown of my mental symptoms and that I thought I had OCD (ignoring any details about being a pedo because I was uncomfortable talking about it to them) and am still waiting for the referral to a specialist who can diagnose me and start treatment.

During that time I got a lot better with less stress in my work life and regular mindfullness meditation, the intrusive thoughts stopped, the genital tingling reduced a fair bit (I was still getting it but it wasn't a constant issue like before and I figured once I got therapy it'd go away) and I didn't feel massively uncomfortable around children (I still had some lingering uncomfortableness but again I figured that'd go away when I got real help).

Kinda NSFW from here


However this is where this things get awful. Now sexually I am a massive sub, I have a size play (giantess) and a milf fetish, about 2 years or so ago this morphed into a mommy fetish or momdom which I really enjoyed. However a considerable amount of the art I was exposed to in this fetish was of little boys getting fucked by moms, and I am ashamed to say I jacked off to that more than a few times (this was something I had also fantasized about as well after getting the fetish). I never viewed it as pedophillia as I was imaging myself as the boy (or man just with a giant partner) getting dommed and since coming to terms with being bi I found the things I found hot in women had a consistent cross over to men (not the age play stuff tho, just the size play/gentle Dom).


Why am I telling you this? Well about 2 weeks ago I was on joi booru or 4chan getting off to some momdom caption porn when I read a comment on how some guy claimed that people who were into this were pedos cause they jacked off to kids, now this triggered my OCD again and I felt like such an awful person because I never thought about what I was jacking off to (I'm not that great at making mental links obviously). 

Even though I always justified it as I was imagining myself as the male sub and I never had any attraction to them in particular, just the relationship dynamic and size difference. Still I couldn't help shake the doubts and am now feeling I'm falling rapidly back to where I was a year ago and am feeling utterly hopeless and fearful this isn't OCD and I genuinely do have a fucked up mind.

I don't deserve forgiveness or anything I had.,"I know I have OCD. For most of my life, since 6, I obsessed over stabbing loved ones. 

These obsessions have altered. I've had them of pushing people onto the road, of swearing at God in Church, at worrying about my sexuality, and now killing my new 7 week son. 

I am taking two antidepressants. I've recently went to a pyschologist which will cost me significantly. We start treatment next week. 

When my partner goes back to work, my Mother is coming to help me as I don't want to be alone with our baby. She is fully aware of my situation but like everyone else; believes I am incapable. 

I truly believe, even with knowing that I have OCD, even knowing that I love my son - that I'll snap and hurt him. That feeling is so real. I truly believe I'd be unable to control myself. I had situations in my past where I lost control. Once, when I was 13 and purposely jumped off a diving board into someone, and again when I was 16 and went to the kitchen to get a knife to stab our dog. (Dog wasn't home though at the time, I didn't know that, though. I sought counseling after that.) 

 If I'm alone at home and have it, what can stop me? I'd love my son. The beautiful baby boy who I went through IVF for. I'd lose my parents and inlaws. My friends would leave. 

All it would take is me losing it for a few minutes. I'd snap back after, feeling cold and terrible. Knowing that I have this obsession, that I *know* I'll cave, throws me back into anxiety. 

What Mother has these urges? I don't feel like I deserve him. I deserve no one. I try to tell my partner this but he doesn't believe I'd snap. 

I am anxious 24/7. My stomach hurts. 

Our area has long wait times for psychiatrist.  I doubt I'd get in as soon as it's needed. There's a lot of support for post natal depression but nothing for post natal OCD. We call my doctor tomorrow.

It's consumed my life. And I'm lonely.  And cannot forgive myself. I shouldn't need my Mom there. But she HAS to, I have to do everything possible to keep my son safe. It all makes no sense but that's how my brain is working. 

I feel like a failure.

I feel sick.  

I don't know what I want from this post. I'm too scared to commit suicide. But I'm suffering. I know I am. I know my brain isn't working properly. I've read every OCD related article I could. There is no relief. 

I want to enjoy my new Motherhood. But would my son love me knowing what I think?

I want to be normal but I know that I have to accept I'm not. I wish I could be happy and just nervous about normal things. 

My friends see me as normal. I've never been able to act but I act so well while I'm dying inside. 

I bet if I had never had OCD, I wouldn't be a threat. I don't hear voices but the feeling of anxiety, of feeling cold, of the never ending thoughts is just as bad.

Am I what I fear? NEWSFLASH: I am not!,"I [18 F] have had intrusive thoughts regarding violence and harming children (POCD) since I was 15. At the time, I was not receiving proper treatment and did not know what was wrong with me. Ever since I was a young child, I‚Äôd wanted to be a mother. When these thoughts started happening I believed I was a risk to children and would be unfit to mother. Then I went to college and things really got out of control. I got new obsessions and old ones came back. I am now seeing an OCD specialist and it‚Äôs made a world of difference. My biggest piece of advice is that a therapist that is properly trained is treating OCD makes a world of difference. I now know that I will be a good mom someday and my thoughts do not define my character. The biggest turning point in my ocd treatment journey, thus far, has been letting go of my reassurance seeking compulsion. Before I met with my new therapist, I had no idea that that was a compulsion and it was driving my ocd. So to everyone in the throngs of ocd, there is hope!

Strong itch like urges to move hands and feet,"have already posted help for this issue on r/adhd thinking that maybe my ADHD has an impact on this behaviour, comments suggested that this may be an OCD issue, I haven‚Äôt a clue what to call this or what branch to label it under but I know it is a psychological thing so I will just post t here.

I have, for the last year had on and off urges to move my hand up and down. Usually this problem disappears for a few months then suddenly reappear for weeks on end. For those weeks I will often throughout the day feel the urge to move my hand up and down this urge will then last for abt 7 minutes. This urge will also almost ALWAYS appear when I need to co-ordinate my hands thus making writing, typing and gaming a frustrating experience, though this is not the case with merely lifting or holding an object. The urge is strong, and no matter how many times I do the action the urge still prevails. The best way I have found to describe the urge is like an itch that never disappears. 

Thinking abt the urge makes it re appear and it is hard to intentionally just forget about it or ignore it. I have tried to resist the urge and silence it no avail. This is hard to explain and I have tried to nail down a name for this issue with no avail.

It's so intense that I have to scream something like ""Mother is dead""(She's alive, though) to distract my mind. I can't sleep sometimes because of so many flashbacks. 

This might explain why I don't like to go to social gatherings. I feel fine at gatherings, but flashbacks of imperfect interactions and fear of misjudgment are torture afterward. When I go out, I don't make eye contact with anyone unless I find someone with whom I have a good connection with already. I kill my emotions and keep my focus away from people, whenever I go to the gym or library to not save more data in my ever-playing OCD flashback movie.",OCD,1579631393,kutta_panchod44,0,1,True,2020-01-21

Did you ever experience OCD while driving?,"I used to enjoy driving so much. It was my passion beacuse i really love cars. During my last journey i almost drove 1000 km (or 600 miles for my American friends here) straight, stopping only for refueling my tank. I cannot do this anymore due to OCD, which i was diagnosed past year on June 30th. At first i could do 30 miles without sweating beacuse my anxiety literally hurts my body. I feel like i'm 90 years old. Now i improved a lot, but When i am driving and i overtake someone on a bike or cross wit a pedestrian my intrusive thoughts start to say: What if you hit that guy and killed him? What if police is out to get you right now? What if you go to jail for the rest of your life? Then i check my car to see signs of crash or accidents. 
The worst comes when i'm driving on my town, beacuse every time i see a speed radar or a camera on a traffic light my heard starts to torture me with thoughts like: what if you got a huge ticket and you couldn't use no more your drive license? 

Nevertheless, i'm not afraid to tackle my thoughts and i planned to go to the US for the first time this year. I really love America and American people and overall american cars and american roads. My therapist and my psychiatrist also approved this journey, but i'm scared to go to jail in the US because of that.

is this promise valid?,"I think before Christmas, I was watching a tv series episode on youtube, and there was a funny scene.

For some reason, I cant remember, I ended up having a compulsion something like ""must not watch a specific dialogue""

I closed the video and somehow, I ended up trying to find which episode it was.

When I found the episode, I checked the beginning of the scene and when I was able to confirm that it was the scene I was watching earlier, I closed it fast.

Days ago, I accidentally watched some seconds from that scene, near that dialogue.

I worry cause I do not remember what exact thoughts without my will created this compulsion. I worry cause I do not remember why I was trying to find out which episode it was. was it just another compulsion? or the thoughts without my will were so scary, that I started trying to find out which episode it was to avoid clicking it in the future? I do not remember

the last days, my thoughts without my will are very scary and I try not to think them but I end up thinking them without my will and then having different compulsions.

sometimes, the last 3 months, when I worry to disobey the compulsion, my system suggests me to generate new thoughts without my will, that will be about promises to God not to obey the compulsion. due to frustration, I want to be free from the compulsion, and my mind allows these thoughts without my will and for a second, I feel relieved. I am like "" I can do what I want now and disobey ocd""

ocd: you just made a rush promise to God to disobey ocd.

there are times I do not disobey ocd and then I worry more because of the relieving thoughts without my will.

ocd: you did not disobey the ocd compulsion and you probably, made a rush promise to God to disobey it. the thoughts without your will, were thoughts without your will, but for a second, you maybe allowed them to pop up in your head on purpose. that makes the promise to God valid.

I cant confirm if the new thoughts without my will that relieve me are 100% without my will or not. I am falling in the same trap, in the last 3 months, many times. I always say to myself, no matter what not to fall in the same trap and that it is better to ignore the first compulsion of the ocd, than playing its game and having new thoughts without my will that relieve me and, maybe acting as if they matter, in order to persuade ocd to leave me alone. its like giving an excuse to ocd that the new thoughts without my will, that are scarier, do not allow me to do the compulsion, so it must not try to give me worries for not doing the compulsion. but it is not valid. maybe I act, for a second, as if the new thoughts without my will maybe matters, in order to make my ocd leave me alone. and I feel relieved. but if I do a mistake and do the compulsion, ocd is more worrying like

ocd: you acted as if the new thoughts without your will about disobeying ocd matter and you felt relieved. maybe that made the thoughts without your will valid. are you sure they were thoughts without your will? you keep doing it many times the last 3 months.

why I always fall in the same trap? are they 100% thoughts without my will?",OCD,1579636285,Zettoraius,3,1,True,2020-01-21
Can someone help me?," Hello everyone!

I write this last night and just copied it and added few stuff here and there I really need help.

So I need some explanation on what is happening to me right now and I will try to make it as simple as possbile and if I make some mistakes while writing this Im sorry English is not my mother language.

So here is my story.Its gonna be a long one and if someone can help me with this please do!

Please read this if you have time and help me if u can because here where I live we dont have a real OCD therapist and even if we did I dont have money to go to session.

I will go full detail so u can understand better!

Im 17 year old boy from Bosnia and I think I have HOCD.Since i was a kid in middle school I was dealing with OCD but I didnt know it was OCD back in the day.When I was younger I obsessed on fear of death and dying.Thoughts were there in my head for maybe a month (I was around 10 or 11) and they wanished and I forgot about it eventually . Next OCD I had was in summer break in 2018 when I had fear and thoughs about me having cancer and it was bad and I had those thoughts for maybe about a month or two and I was constantly checking and searching online for signs of cancer and stuff like that.And those thoughts left and I forgot about it and I was back to normal again.And I didnt have any OCD thoughts until last year (2019 summer break) Ok this is where it begins. One night I was in my bed listening to music and just chillin and out of nowhere intrusive thought comes in my head (Hey what if you wanted to go to kitchen and get a knife and kill your parents while they are sleeping) I froze in fear and I had that bad felling inside me and I almost bursted into tears because of that thought.

It was there for some time and it left and I continued with my life.

So this is where HOCD starts.First time of HOCD was when I was in italy with my parents in november 2019 and we were in car and it was just a normal car drive and again out of nowhere this thought comes (What if you dont like girls anymore?What if you are not interested in girls?) Again I froze in fear and I obsessed about that thought for maybe a 1-2 hours and I went to sleep and I forgot about it and everything was back to normal for maybe a month.

Just to clarify something I was into (and still am) into girls since I know for myself and even since I started going to school.I had few girlfriends,had a first kiss,almost had sex one time,never thought about doing something with anoter dudes or something like that.

So after new year 2020 I started having those intrusive thoughts (HOCD) again and it was to the point where I would just sit on edge of my bed and started shaking and leaning back and forth and just wondering what is happening to me?I googled some stuff and found out about HOCD and how to accept the thoughts and release that anxiety and stress that u experience.I took the hocd test and it showed that I had HOCD.

Eventually those thoughts became less frequent and I didnt have that much anxiety and I had few backdoor spikes here and there and they have gone away too.

But as those thoughts left and I thought its over I found another problem. My sex drive and attraction to girls is almost gone its still here but its gone and I get anxious because of that and I have inability to feel pleasure in normally pleasurable activities.When ever I beat the thought and I realise its just a thoughts my brain comes again with (But what if?) (What if u are in denial) and I get anxious again.

Its to the point where I get anxious over the simplest thought.

I get very anxious when I hear or read word Gay.

Its to the point where i cant enjoy things I used to enjoy things like motorcycles,cars,my future,girls,starting a family and few others.

And Ive experienced my mental pain becomes physical every part of my body hurts

I have girls hitting on me almost every day and I love it but my brain keeps telling me I dont?

Like what is happening?

Let me tell you something or here is a comment that I left on youtube video about HOCD

I got rid of anxiety caused by those thoughts by simply accepting the thought as OCD thought.And eventually i stopped having those thoughts but as they left it took everything I enjoyed with it. For my whole life i wanted a wife,kid just to start a family but as OCD left it took all my hobies and activites i enjoyed with it and i get scarred by that. Any suggestion on how to get those feeling back? I always wanted to become a dad and I still want that but idk why it feels so meaning less for some reason like why? I always had crushes on girls and i still have but i dont feels that same energy as i used to have back before OCD.I always dreamed about traveling with my wife and all that stuff.I always enjoyed dreaming and fantasizing about girls from my class and girls i knew but i dont enjoy that much anymore and then when i realise i dont enjoy it that much i start to get anxiety. What to do I want old me back. I dont get aroused by other dude but I do when I see a good looking girl on ig or facebook. I always had crushes on girls even since i was like 4 lol im 17 now. I always talk about girls when im with my friends. But im single for a year and a half and i think that could be a problem...maybe? For those wondering how i stopped being anxious by OCD thought its simple it took me about 2 days. Just accept it when the thought comes just accept it as the thought and continue with what u doing. Dont avoid! If u like watching movies go watch movies and dont avoid.U like music then listen to music and dont avoid it. Dont avoid going out with MALE friends on coffee or to play games or something like that. I didnt avoid Those above and i got better. Only thing that bothers me now is depression. Yes OCD can cause depression and lose of intress in things u used to enjoy and its happenig to me rn and it scares the shit out of me for some reason but i hope it will get better and I start crushing on girls again.

I feel empty and every time I think about me and my future I feel nothing as I used to feel and suicidal thoughts cross my mind sometimes.

I just want old me back,my old thoughts and feelings!

I cant even think about certain things without getting anxious or scared.

When new intrusive thoughts pop up I get scared and anxious and again I start to shake back and forth.

I cant even listen to music that I liked the most,I cried so many times because of my crushes on girls and breakups,I miss cuddling with gf and I want all of this back but my brain keeps telling me different and keeps playing with me! Just want old me back and my old crushes.

I hope this was enough and I hope that someone can help me with this!

should I open and read it?," I worry a lot about an ocd compulsion that was created, I think, before Christmas, because probably, some thoughts without my will about a promise to God popped up in my head. they were about I think, not watching a specific dialogue or a scene or a quote from a tv episode on youtube.

 I do not remember much. I do not remember how this compulsion was created. I was watching the beginning of the scene and I ended up closing it but I cant remember why or what exactly, were thoughts without my will.

 I remember trying to find the episode but I do not remember why I was trying to find it. maybe to make sure to avoid it in the future because the thoughts without my will were very scary? or it was just a compulsion? I do not remember.


 When I found the episode, I clicked to see if it contains the scene I was watching, and when I saw the beginning of the scene I closed it, anxiously.


   Days ago, I accidentally clicked that episode and saw some seconds, from that scene. I started worrying. I do not remember why I ended up so much worrying about that scene? was it just a scene or just a specific dialogue? I do not remember

   I think, there was a specific time in the comments about the scene I was watching and someone was talking about something in a specific minute and second. I think, I was interested to see what he meant but automatically, I had some thoughts without my will. that probably, created the compulsion ""must not watch that second""

  I remember having the same thing with other videos and I think I had same case in the same tv series but I do not remember if it was an other scene or if it was this scene.

  I worry and am thinking if maybe, I could open the video and read the comments, maybe that will bring more clues to my memory about how this compulsion was created or how scary it was. maybe I will be able to calm down but I worry so much to even open the video.

ocd: open the video and see the comments. you will read something that will help you remember and then you will be able to calm down but there is a chance, that you wont find anything and then feel more worried because on purpose, you will be reading comments from the video that containted the scene that contained the dialogue you were not supposed to watch. maybe it is better to ignore it since you only saw some seconds of the scene and it was accidentally. maybe it will make you more worried if you read the comments.

Advice for sufferers of Pure O OCD,"Do not make any research about the subject you are worried about. What I mean is, don't search for: pedophilia, zoophilia, psicopaths, sociopaths, etc.

OCD is fake,"Ocd id fake. im gon tell you why,i basically had odc for 5 years or 6 i dont remember since i was very young didnt even know what it was,just was always having intrusive thoughts and images which i had to lose weight,or some shit like that,that had to repeat the same thing,lights on,lights off

And i used to use subliminals for ocd,kinda relief but temporary,what ""cured"" me you'll understand whhy i put the "" "".

&amp;#x200B;

I started off by seeing in reddit and posts google u know forums,how to cure,and i was already gettin better,but still had a lot of thoughts.

I saw in some posts,that u basically if u accepted it,it goes by itself,as it came by itself,accepting your thoughts,not reacting to them,etc.

&amp;#x200B;

It really helped,but it still was hard,i didnt know why.

I used to be always trynna fix in my mind the right position,i was basically still interacting with them.

Thats the problem,interacting.

That was the problem.

&amp;#x200B;

I had thoughts that i always reacted,like about death,something happening in the future,u know,anxiety,had past thoughts that gave me guilt and depression.

&amp;#x200B;

All mental ilness is fake,they make it a ""disease"" just as the physhical one are,cancer is fake,all that bs,starting understanding this trap u are in,that is the system,the society.

&amp;#x200B;

They all made it up,and they basically tell u always got to do some to cure it,which your body is perfect,nature is perfect,you would never have a disease,u just was told that its natural to have diseases.

The comes the mind part,they always make u think that,fear death,fear this and that,and u make worries out of it,u always trapped in your mind,mostly with anxiety and depression that almost every1 nowadays in society has,with phones,news,mostly always death news and shit.

&amp;#x200B;

U cant trust a unknown people right,but u can trust the media that u dont know who is behind,just see faces u never seen,u trust it? U say it is true just because someone told u in the news?

&amp;#x200B;

They can tell that someone got shot,and that person doesnt even exist u would believe right.

Same as u believe doctors,hospitals,if they say u got cancer,its true and u gon die,thats what u would think prolly.

Trust only yourself,your mind,your inside.

&amp;#x200B;

Best reliefs for my ocd,was through meditation.

&amp;#x200B;

Meditation is not of a big deal as we told it is,dont let no1 tell how to do,do it your ways.

All u suppose to do,at least that i do,is being aware of something,learning to accept your thoughts,be aware of your breathing,at first might be hard,but remember,we are told that pain is bad and shit,but thats the reason why u always give up,u give up at the feeling,u react to it,u fear.

If u dont accept that pain and feelings u wont pass,u will be reacting.

U know why this all bs,government doesnt want u to be ok.

Dont trust science nor other kind of shit of doctors that heal,they DONT.

Basically im telling you know,acceptance is the cure,and i always used to think i had to do some,i had to fix this thoughts,i had to reject it,because i didnt wanna feel that feeling of or shame,rage, u know,but i could never fix it because i was TRYNNA fix it,thats is the problem,we always think we never right,we are sick so we got to fix it right?, No we dont have to,all u got to do is just feel it,u are afraid of having these thoughts again,you are afraid of feeling anxiety,sadness.

But remember if they exists,is for some reason,its all feelings u suppose to feel,they exist for that,life is a game,death is good,hell and heaven is fake,u can believe it,dont judge,its your mind,but its fake,because u believing on it based on what u been told,not what u lived,not what u saw.

Faith is not what bible told u like,if u dont believe god,just because u need proofs,u dont have faith,thats a sin,fuck that.

&amp;#x200B;

Accept what u feel,listen to alan watts,learned a lot from him,terence mckenna is good too,u are told not being happy,or being sad,hurt,rage,is wrong,and that only hapiness and those kind of feelings are right and good.

""ego"" is made up,we judge everything because we all think information is a blessing right.

But its the root of all this,basically our language,our judgement like fat,skinny,this that,black,white, u know u always categorize a person like that,she is this she is that,no,she is no1,that all is what foods your thoughts,and everything is right and wrong,everything is everything and nothing is nothing.

They make u have a name so u always indentify yourself you know,u always something,and bad things are demons and good are angels,u know u always something.

Dont try to fix your ""disease"",your ""ocd"",your ""depression"",accept it,acceptance is how i ""lost "",no how i  accepted my fears,fearing is good,is totally normal,dont try to lose your fears,dont fight them,dont nothing. Have them,but just be yourself,you are not your thoughts,they will never go away,if your ocd hitting now,like ""they will never go away omg"",dont do nothing,u already good,just keep breathing,i used to stop breathing,and was falling on my thoughts,while i was ok,all i had to do is breath,i had that ocd about breathing,sensimotor or something,all u have to do is nothing,let u notice u  are breathing why are you worried no sense? let it flow,just keep breathing,breath normally if u got thoughts that u dont know how,just keep,u dont need to know.

Anyways,it is not in the first day or time or anything,that i goes away,it goes away by itself,basically just keep living your life,you will keep noticing them what u do when they pop up? Nothing,get back to present,to reality,to get back what u do? Nothing,u will understand.

Anyways if u think its bullshit,its your problem,keep believing media,i know a lot of people say they are skeptical to this and that that are spiritual,or meditation,or what i be saying,but if u are skeptical to this why u not skeptical to what u told in ""history"" in school,all that bullshit,u believe it,someone told u about u didnt came up with these things,u know,what doctors say samething, anyways if u accept it by just doing nothing,take this to your life,dont do nothing that aint the present,time is an illusion,we all live in the present,thats why u will never see the future,even if u think u did,future dont exist,future is a product of the present and past too,i mean they dont exist,only the now.

Acceptance.

Not doing nothing.

I recently got an OCD diagnosis, and SO many things make more sense. As a child (8ish) I would be terrified to forget/lose things. Making mistakes made me feel like i was ""bad"". I was really messy. I kept all papers, art projects, gifts, trinkets, etc.

Logical right? Lol

Now if those are the risks I'm thinking I should probably just kill myself. Safer right? I mean I can't take THAT chance. And it's not like I like living that much anyway. I am constantly haunted by my own mind. So like what's that point you know?

Lately my OCD and anxiety have been worse than usual.,"For instance, when I watch a show, I start to become distracted by overwhelming feelings that I should just restart the episode. Or once I'm done with an episode, I feel this empty feeling and this feeling that I should rewatch it. 

I've also been struggling with this depression and anxiety that just makes it hard to get through the day to day.

This used to happen from time to time but it's been feeling worse lately. I really don't have a desire to get out of bed in the morning. I don't think I could ever kill myself for fear of what would happen to me but sometimes I just wish it was an option. Like I could shut off the faucet of anxiety.

"Tips for all, especially the OCD-afflicted youth","Hey everyone, 

I recently shared the lengthy message below with a young man and wanted to share it with the rest of you in hopes of that it will benefit you. Have a beautiful day and do your best to not give in to the OCD (starting with the smallest of the fears).  


\---------------------------------

...Thank you for being brave and reaching out to someone and talk about how you feel. Seeking help shows that you care about your wellness and are willing to do something about it :)

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't fully recovered from OCD, but I will share with you what I've found helpful as I grew up with it. 

&amp;#x200B;

OCD's fuel is fear. The reality is, they are just thoughts. And thoughts can't hurt you. 

&amp;#x200B;

What helps you relax? I've found prayer, meditation, and some entertainment can help remove the distress. 

&amp;#x200B;

Try planning your next day today. From waking time to sleep time. You can keep it simple for yourself, like in 5 bullets or less. The trick is to keep yourself busy and productive so the OCD doesn't get the opportunity to gobble down more fuel. 

&amp;#x200B;

Try telling yourself, ""I'm not gonna pay attention to it today, but maybe in two days or next week. These thoughts can't hurt me. I am safe, I am fine, I am healthy."" The goal here is to forget about the fears and end up not caring about them. It was difficult for me to do this (and some psychologists and therapists say this isn't helpful), but taking medication after seeing a doctor and a psychiatrist really improved my mental health and I was thus able to do this more easily and defeat some of my worst OCD fears!

&amp;#x200B;

Another trick I learned was from a blog written by a user called Evelyn when I was 16 and was having one of my depressing OCD episodes. The person in the blog said that he/she treated the negative thoughts like a computer error message. Whenever it would pop up, he/she would say ""cancel"" to cancel the thought. With practice, he/she was able to succeed and develop into the person he/she wanted to be. 

&amp;#x200B;

Affirmations. This is very powerful. Affirmations are present-tense positive statements that can change the way you think and feel and even change habits! For instance, if you fear walking outside, you can say ""I'm comfortable walking outside, it's easy, and refreshing to get natural air"", rather than saying ""I WILL be comfortable walking outside"". You can do this looking yourself in the mirror with a smile and confidence and repeat it as many times as you are comfortable with. With practice and patience, your doubts, self-doubts, may just become a stepping stone into a much more positive version of yourself :)

&amp;#x200B;

Other few non-related OCD tips to help you through your youth (if it's relevant to you): delete all your social media  (not talking about goal-based ones like LinkedIn to network as a professional or useful parts of Reddit where people can actually learn from each other and grow), stop comparing yourselves with other kids and people who seem to have a ""perfect"" life (they are just displaying bits of their good parts of their lives with a smile on camera on social media), and try to control your sexual urges (not referring to HOCD, but in general) and pursuing the sex you're attracted to like a hungry puppy. I have wasted a lot of my youth on excess entertainment, staying up late into the night doing useless things like watching countless junk YouTube videos, pornography, chasing girls and women, social media, self-sabotaging by procrastinating on tasks to the point that minutes become hours, hours become days, days become months, and months become years, and years...well, you get the point...---and I wish I could have all that time back now to start all over again. I still have some of these bad habits up until today, and I am trying to progress, no matter how slow or little I go. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: OCD's fuel is anxiety and fears. Seeing a psychiatrist/professional therapist, canceling negative thoughts by saying ""cancel"" as if it were a computer error message, delaying giving into the ritual/intrusive thought by delaying it a day/week/etc., planning out your days and week ahead, trying to stay busy and productive, and deleting junk social media (where it's not productive) and comparing yourself to others---all these just might help you lead a more healthier and happier life, even if a little :)  All the best.",OCD,1579667892,Evening_101,0,1,True,2020-01-21
Question for thought-checkers,"Recently, my schiz-OCD has been trying to make me think I'm becoming delusional.  As bad as it is to do so, I fell back to thought-checking.

What I noticed when doing it is that, when I try to ""disprove"" the thought, my brain locks down and won't give me an answer of any kind.  It feels stuck and blank.  If I do it over and over, eventually it clicks and I can move on. 

I noticed a similar thing when dealing with suicide-OCD a while back.  Prior to that, my OCD wasn't really in my head (handwashing/door-checking), so I didn't notice anything like this (though I did have a staring ritual; that was fun).

Since then. She has stared experiencing  pain in her left arm, hand, and  leg . She of corse googles everything  and all her symptoms leg to a blood clot. Skip forward 9 months and we had 6 d dimers done that all show negative. 10 emergency room visited and 20+ visits with doctors. It has been an endless cycle of negative results and dr. Appointments. Recently we were finally referred to a specialist who did some vein testing with did show that she has Venus insufficiency. In her leg and a 50% blockage in her arm. We don‚Äôt know what the blockage is but it looks like is an insufficient vain. My wife is Convinced it is a clot.

I had forgotten about this but now that i remember i really just need to vent.,"So a couple weeks ago my family had gone out with my cousin and afterwards she came back to our house to hang out for a bit. After our parents went to bed my brother and i asked her if she wanted to sneak out with us. We ended up driving to sunset boulevard in LA (about a 45 minute drive) where we parked, my brother smoked some weed and drank a few shots of vodka. We got out of the car, walked down the street and went into some shops before we walked back to the car. I dont know how the conversation got where it did but basically my brother was talking about what my mom says about me when im not around. He told me she says that i have bad anxiety and ocd and my brother said that that wasnt true. He told me how i didnt have ocd and that ocd was hand washing. I said that i do and that while that is a part of ocd, thats not the only type of ocd. I told him that it had a lot to do with the thoughts and he said something like ""well duh"". We got in the car and started driving. I was really upset and didn't want to talk so i just sat silent. They started asking what to do next and eventually asking me what was wrong, i just kept saying i was fine. Because for real, you can't figure out why im upset? I know he was drunk and probably doesn't even remember but it still really hurts. Anyways i got over it after a bit and by the end of the night i had a great time but the moment i got home and in bed i just started crying because my brother had just comfirmed all those intrusive thoughts. ""I dont have ocd"" ""im being overdramatic"" ""im a liar"" ""i dont need help"" ""im fine""

How do I stop anxiety rambling myself deeper into the hole in conversations... or is this normal?,"I find that this happens to me a lot, but usually when I get under 8 hours sleep which I really can't help because I have a chronic pain disease that wakes me up and I usually get 6 hours. It's just how I live, eternally tired.

My thoughts are cloudy coupled with OCD. It causes me to just burst things out and then have to backtrack but I never backtrack well. I feel like I don't have control. *Example:*

Today my friends (lets call them Jack, James and Danielle) and I were playing a board game. We broke for lunch, and while eating, Jack started talking (harmlessly) about his ex roommate (Tom) my old friend from college, who I knew were in a fight for two years but more recently I've become close friends with Jack and wanted to make sure Tom didn't do anything crazy to him. 

After all, Tom has been estranged from the larger friend group and dropped off the face of the earth. I myself have had roommates who did this, and it was usually because they did something insane, and since Jack and I have only become close friends recently and now see each other twice a week, I wanted to ask to deepen the friendship and establish trust.

Without thinking, purely on newly-comfortable impulse with a new friend, I said ""what happened between you two?""

Everyone else in the room shot daggers at me. I knew I had done something wrong.

Jack sorta fumbles: ""Oh. I don't really want to gossip about someone I know you're friends with."" 

Instantly I see that I am the asshole here, because it makes it look like I shit talk my friends. I didn't mean to do that. I panic. 

Somehow, my anxiety brain digs the hole deeper: ""I just want to make sure Tom isn't crazy. The kind of guy who *hits people* or something. Uh, my last roommate did that (SHE DID, WE EVICTED HER) and uh, I dunno. I guess I wanted to know if he was crazy.""

James is confused ""I thought he was your friend? Why do you think he did something crazy?"" Now everyone is kinda looking at me. Jack sets off to explain the 100 things he hates about Tom, and now James and Danielle are staring suspicious daggers at me. They're probably thinking ""If Clear-Bandicoot says THIS stuff about her friends, what does she say about US?""

Jack finishes his story and it's super awkward. I've managed to make nice game lunch gossipy and bad. As he's telling me all these bad roommate things Tom did (passive aggressive, never paid rent, etc) I start going ""Aw that sucks, damn, yeah that sucks."" And I feel like I sound like a terrible friend.

I end it with him ""I didn't mean to open old wounds or anything! I was just trying to-"" Fumble again... ""Make sure he wasn't a murderer or something haha!"" God, my anxiety is in full control. 

Jack kinda gives me a weird face. ""No. I don't wanna talk shit about him.""

We just go back to the game and I feel hung up and anxious about it the rest of the day. I don't like gossip or shit talking, my question came from a place of genuine concern. I haven't heard from Tom in a year and I wondered what he did. I didn't get to explain myself other than what was said there. I feel like I lost everyone's trust tonight due to anxiety. Or maybe it sounds worse to me? This new friend circle within the larger circle was a nice clean slate for me. My deepest fear is when people get close to me they will ""realize I'm bad"" (My OCD) and these sort of incidents reinforce it for me. What to do?",OCD,1579677624,Clear-Bandicoot,4,1,True,2020-01-22
"Ive never considered ocd before now. First i realized the similarities to ocd pure o, and my thoughts. Then other things, could these be ocd tendencies?","(I know you cant diagnose me, i just wanna know if these things would be even considered ocd behaviour)

I have to count to ten in my head before I can pee.

Liquid food cant touch on the plate. Juice from meat cant touch sauce, etc. Different color sauce cant touch. I can not eat from another persons spoon, if the food is anything that can melt. It is the worst thing ever.

My guts will fall out if someone pokes a finger in my bellybutton. When i was a kid i had the same fear, but couldnt stop scrathing until it bleed, which was a horrible limbo. Its gotten better.

I am terrified of jewerly. I cant touch it, and I seriously rather not touch anyone who is wearing it. Ive asked people to take it off. Also need to wash my hands if i at very rare occasion have touched some, because its gross and awful on my fingers.

When i was a kid i would feel the same about buttons and zippers, and would have giant meltdowns if they were on me.

When i was younger i for a period had to count to ten while walking outside, and had to reach to a certain point before i got to ten (over and over) or else i might die.

The issue is, in the past, these things did happen with him, he broke up with me and had some women in his life soon after. (Not cheating just quick move on) This was years ago and also when our relationship sucked. Things are so different now but its hard when i have these moments of ROCD because the past almost validates it.

Finally Accepting the Compulsions,"A long time ago, I'd read online about the importance of ""surrendering"" when it comes to addressing OCD; it took me a while to acknowledge this, and even longer to accept it. For the past few days, I've been in a shitty place - mental contamination makes me feel as if everything that I've ever done, and every part of my identity has been ""corrupted.""

Typically, it manifests itself in a manner where the first time that I see something that I didn't know, I can't be thinking about any particular person, or otherwise, it'll feel tainted. Over the years, this has led to a growing list of ""untouchable"" topics that have been breaking down my identity until there was very little left.

The fact that I like compartmentalizing my personality doesn't help, because whenever I give up a ""label"" that I've considered essential to my character, it causes a long period of dissociation.

However, on January the 3rd, I'd realized that enough is enough after a streak of ""contaminations"" over the holidays that left me unable to function properly. For the first time in my life, I acknowledged that the thoughts are the result of a mental illness, and bear no significance to who I am or the fact that they can ""corrupt"" things. 

Ever since then, I've been having good days and bad days, but, I can feel that things are improving - today's the first day where I'm completely stopping myself from reassuring myself that ""oh, but, there're all these other UNCORRUPTED things that you can do, how could you deal with the tainted ones?""

But, when I acknowledge that it's all just a symptom of a mental illness, I feel a whole lot better about it. There's still the feeling of strong unease towards dealing with previously tainted topics, but, I'm working on it, and right now, am trying to consciously stop myself from indulging in the self-reassurance thought patterns.

It's difficult without a therapist or a psychologist, and all of this has been mostly me prodding through the internet, which is why I must say that this subreddit has helped me immensely in accepting things. After seeing a few people suffering from the same sorts of symptoms, I've found the confidence to try cofronting it head-on.

Through all this, I have to acknowledge that having loved ones that are supportive and understanding is a must. Without my wonderful girlfriend, who'd been stopping me from overthinking and my mother, who'd encouraged me to finally deal with this, I wouldn't have been able to get past even the first step of accepting the fact that - while a part of me - OCD is not a part of who I am.

In addition, I've found myself a mantra to use as reassurance and to calm myself down. Right now, things aren't looking so bright, but, I do think that they'll get better. They have to.

Sorry for the ramble - I just needed to get this off my chest.

Please Help,"I just need some encouragement. Or advice? 

I have suffered from OCD since I was very, very little. When I was an alcoholic, it kept the OCD at bay because the alcohol could distract me. Now, that I am sober, it has come back with a vengeance (I am not currently in therapy). 

My latest obsession is getting the mail. My mail is in a P.O. Box across town (I moved) and I am terrified to go get it. The thought of going makes my heart race and I get shortness of breath. I can link it to my taxes. I filed 3 years worth of taxes recently and I am terrified I am going to get audited and go to jail. No real reason. I spoke with an IRS person and they told me  I owe more than I should and perhaps I am doing something wrong, but I definitely did not lie on them (did not claim any expenses, didn't claim any dependents because I don't have any). Even an IRS person assured me I won't go to jail. 

Or, I am afraid I will have an indictment letter (just FYI I have never broken the law). I had some old credit cards (I am talking like 7-8 years ago) that I defaulted on, I took them out when I was like 22 and put I made more money than I did (not that much) but I was so young! I am worried I will go to jail for that.

But the IRS is the big worry. And I understand it is completely irrational. I speak with the IRS often and they told me 2 weeks ago that they haven't sent me any recent letters (I do owe, but like $3000 max). 

Another worry is cancer. I have a tiny (what looks to be) a bug bite on my leg that was once a big wound but has shrunk in size over a month. Now it looks like a tiny, round sore. I had one doctor (via JustAnswer) tell me that it might be ""basal cell carcinoma"", but another doctor things that is not the case because to him, it doesn't look like cancer and it's shrinking and healing. He said not to worry about it.

I am in recovery for alcoholism, and go to AA meetings. But this is hard, as everyone who has OCD knows. With the cancer thing, I really went through a few days of total mania (I was in therapy then) that hasn't happened to me in years. I would so appreciate if someone could just reiterate to me how irrational these fears are.

Does This Seem Like OCD?,"One story I remember from my childhood that seems especially relevant is that I was told by a friend that if you ever told a lie to god you would die in your sleep.

I even tearfully wrote a diary entry that I was convinced would be my last.

"""Unclean"" Things - Especially Books","I have fairly severe OCD but have mostly recovered on my own.   


The only thing left is that I do not want ""clean"" items to touch dirty items. I've managed to stop caring as much about things like clothes that can be washed, but I still struggle when it comes to books. I never want to bring books anywhere. I will not put books in my purse, or put my planner in my purse, or put them down on any table that doesn't have a clean towel down on it first. The only place I feel comfortable putting my books is on my desk or bed at home.   


I travel frequently and rent houses in other countries, and I never bring books with me except my textbooks, and even bringing those makes me feel really uncomfortable because I don't know where I can study without them touching something dirty. I hardly use my diary or planner, and I just wish I could function normally because I love to write, I love to read, I love to plan things out, and I cannot do any of this because it just bothers me if any of the covers or pages touch anything ""dirty"".",OCD,1579718275,Morphiadz,1,1,True,2020-01-22

So, one of the things that really messes with my OCD (Thanks to my parents being abusive as fuck about spending and money) is spedning in non-essential things. basically when I swipe my credit card to pay for a bar of chocolate, I look like Ariel in the Disney movie as she signs the contract with Ursula. 

Today, I decided to go against the symptoms. I bought a Starsip in Star Trek Online.

For those of us who check the stove 85 times to make sure it‚Äôs off..,"One of my many compulsions is to check if the stove burners are off over and over again. I‚Äôve done it since I was maybe 8 or 9 years old. I recently tried something new (to me) to see if it would help. I originally learned about saying a random word after you‚Äôve done the initial check (the idea is since the word is so random, you should remember saying it) but I got tired of saying ‚Äúpony!‚Äù every time. (See? Very random) So, I tried tapping near each knob. I tap my nail by each of the burner knobs. Once I hear the 4 taps, it tends to register better in my head that I‚Äôve already checked the burners. 4 burners, 4 taps. All off. Has anyone tried either technique and how have they worked for you?

Anybody feels like giving up the fight against OCD?,"I guess this is my 2nd post here. I'm in a university now and I'm just basically tired. My life has become a game at this moment. Whenever there's a little ray of hope that comes in and I become happy, BOOM! I go back to being depressed again. It's like life has some sort of an agenda against me. I lost my brother last year, my family and I are on better terms now atleast. I had a few close friends who now ignore my texts and have blocked my phone number or just don't pick up my call. And their brilliant excuse is they're busy but they're always hanging out with their other friends. So basically, I now have 1 friend who's been there with me since I was in 8th. Depression seems to be my constant mood. My body feels broken and sometimes even getting out of my body causes more pain than when I broke my hand. Somehow my memory is a lot weaker when I'm depressed and I've lost interest in everything I love like arts, games  My girlfriend, who was with me for 5 years, left me because she changed and she wants to focus on herself but in reality she just wanted to dump me because well she's in a new place and she's met someone.

I have no idea where to go from here.. ? Long post sorry..,"Hello everybody hope all is well and door is the best if they can be today I know what that feels like I‚Äôve been struggling with intrusive thoughts and random mood swings. 
Wondering if somebody could provide some clarity for me I‚Äôve had intrusive thoughts and ritualistic behavior ever since I was 12. I was going through those phases I didn‚Äôt really know what OCD was or what I was doing and I never really talked to anybody about it. I just thought it was a normal part of life and everybody struggled with this and it was a normal part of the day for everybody. And I just dealt with it and treated it as if it was just a normal part of life all the way up until this past October. Where I was already six months in to supplementing CBD which helped with a lot of things but this past October I integrated it with some unknown strain of weed (I know sounds sketchy) 
But the person that I smoked it with swore up to high heaven that it wasn‚Äôt synthetic and it was natural he just simply forgot the strain because he bought it so long ago and he was on a hiatus himself . I noticed as soon as I did it I didn‚Äôt feel anything I didn‚Äôt get high, I got bored and went to bed. 
A couple of days later is when I noticed my intrusive thoughts amplified to a point where it was practically crippling because it was thoughts about sexualization and murder and just some of the most disturbing things that you can possibly think of and the fact that I‚Äôve never really thought of things this intense that frequently made me sick to my stomach. I don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like to murder somebody but I‚Äôm more than sure if I did the feeling would be exactly like having these thoughts because guilt and sickness sits at the bottom of your stomach to very ugly feeling. I had to go to the bathroom multiple times throughout the day for about a month until it got to a point to where my mind literally I guess just got used to the thoughts and I was just like meh. 
It desensitize me in a sense and then I started obsessing about that and now I purposefully have intrusive thoughts every now and again to see if they still bother me to see if I guess I‚Äôm still human or if those intrusive thoughts have made me into some kind of psychopath or sociopath. Then I‚Äôll obsess about that so none of the less intrusive thoughts have stopped but the obsessions are still there every now and again. 
I also noticed after that first months of intense intrusive thoughts after a dissipated the only thing I was left with was desensitization and not feeling anything I literally wouldn‚Äôt feel anything and I would just go through the motions of my day. Then sporadically I‚Äôll get some intense emotion of ‚Äúholy crap I feel like I‚Äôm gonna explode because I really need to do something like run a mile or do some push-ups‚Äù and the fact that I was just staying still observing these moment just made me that much more anxious and I didn‚Äôt know how to get rid of it it was almost like I wanted to scream.
 Then that evolved into fits of rage id find myself clenching my teeth  and just feeling angry I wasn‚Äôt angry at anybody in particular, but it was just a feeling of anger and I‚Äôm not really sure if that was OCD to and I was just obsessing over the feeling of anger? and that has stayed consistent all the way up until today I guess you can say November all the way until today. It‚Äôs not as intense now though I guess because I got used to it just like the thoughts..  don‚Äôt get me wrong it wasn‚Äôt all bad and sad and gloomy days I would get random days where I was happy and hopeful and cherry for a little bit but it wouldn‚Äôt last long.. 



TLDR  I was wondering if anybody has had any experience with this or have had some sort of similar experience with weed or just in general and how they have conquered it if they are taking supplements like St. John‚Äôs wort or GABA or same or any of those brain chemical supplements or if they have used CBD to balance things.. I‚Äôve even contemplated finding a nearby lab to get a neurotransmitter test to see what brain chemicals I‚Äôm low on and what brain chemicals I‚Äôm high on or if that‚Äôs even possible? Any one have any info on that?

What if this isn't OCD and I'm trans deep down? Help me I hate this,"I know I shouldn't be asking for reassurance but I can't help myself. I've had 4 doctors diagnose me with OCD but I don't believe them. What if it turns out I'm actually trans and I was denying it the whole time? I keep having these mental images of me in a woman's body which I don't like or want but don't give me nearly as much anxiety as before. No jealousy, no repulsion, just pure anxiety and numbness. I still get anxious looking in the mirror but only in my high OCD periods, when it's a good day I don't get that. I keep having this thing where I don't nearly as often think I'd like to look like bigger stronger guys I see (I'm super weak and skinny and this used to be near constant for me, until a few weeks ago). This feels SO REAL and it is much harder now for me to imagine myself looking like other guys I see even though this used to be what I thought all the time. When I had POCD I had horrible horrible awful thoughts of doing unspeakable things to babies and kids I saw, when it receded I recognized after the fact they were intrusive thoughts and I didn't actually think it intentionally or enjoyed the thoughts, it was just a haywire brain. They felt SO REAL at the time though, I hated it and genuinely thought I had become a pedophile overnight. But what if I never actually had POCD and I'm just making up an experience that didn't happen so I can deny being trans a little longer? I'm also worried that I have some combination of BPD, Bipolar, and Klinefelter syndrome, even though my doctors say there's no chance (I have normal sized genitals, or at least I think so... I'm terrified I have BPD even though the doc doesn't think so, same for bipolar).

Would a trans person pre-everything feel numbness/anxiety or happiness when using the snapchat gender swap filter? I tried it out, it didn't look like me, looked like I was looking at a different person, but it gave me a lot of anxiety and I just felt numb and confused. No happy feelings at all. Even though I don't want to look like that (what if... shut up OCD brain) what if I actually do want it and I'm too afraid to admit it to myself and the anxiety is cover for dysphoria and I'm trans and in denial? I DON'T WANT TO BE A WOMAN I JUST WANT TO BE HAPPY WITH MYSELF AGAIN WITHOUT THIS ANXIETY AND NONSENSICAL THINKING I LOVED BEING A MAN MY WHOLE LIFE AND NOW THERE IS SO MUCH DOUBT AND SECOND GUESSING AND ANXIETY. I liked pink as a color when I was 5 and I'm a 4.5-5 on the Kinsey scale does that mean I'm actually trans? I hate this. What if deep down I really want to be a woman and all the things of loving being a man my whole life and extremely loving masculinity a ton especially over the last 3-4 years was actually a lie and scrambled memories, not real memories, and I was trans and in denial and hated myself the whole time and my happiness was fake?

Is it really possible to LOVE your gender identity as a man your whole life and suddenly wake up trans right before your 22nd birthday? I had always LOVED being a man, felt great, lots of positive energy, never had issues with it at all. Rationally this feels like clear cut OCD but the other half of my brain is telling me that I only hate the idea of being a woman because I'm in denial and I've never liked being a man and I have to transition even if I will hate it. Literally never thought about it before it popped into my head a couple months ago one morning as I was waking up. I had been surrounded by trans people ever since college started 3 and a half years ago, and a close friend of mine came out as trans 2 years ago now, and none of that made me have any of these thoughts. I remember getting really annoyed at a roommate who would habitually call almost everyone by they/them pronouns even when he knew their gender identity and I made it very clear to him that I was a man and not a ""they"" and didn't like being referred to that way. But what if I actually wanted to be referred to as ""she"" and this was another sign of denial? This was 2 and a half years ago.

I don't want to be trans, I don't want to be a woman, I just want to be back to being happy as a man without this nonsense obsessing the way I was until 8 weeks ago. But my OCD (I hope) is making me feel like I should want to be a woman even though I don't. Spent my whole life admiring male role models, wanting to be more masculine, liking my male characteristics, bonding socially much more closely with men than with women, etc. I still feel that way deep down (I think -- OCD makes it hard to tell because every definitive thought is answered by 10 immediate ""what if""s) but the OCD is scrambling my brain so much that it's hard for me to tell anything anymore. I hate this, I just want my brain back.

I also love having my deep voice and the thought of a high squeaky woman's voice coming out of my mouth freaks me out. And I would hate myself for life my penis and balls were cut off, it's essential to who I am and my self identity as a man.

The idea of being a mother horrifies me, so does the idea of dying a woman, being called mom, being remembered as a woman, having a woman's name on my gravestone. But what if I'm not actually horrified and it's deep denial? Nothing makes sense I hate this.",OCD,1579727948,Ocdtransthrowaway882,7,1,True,2020-01-22
Is this text response too rude to send to anOCD roommate!?,"My roommate is driving me crazy. She keeps moving my stuff to her liking. In the kitchen, hallway, bathroom.

Hi everyone. I making this post due to the fact that I just don't feel like I can fight or ignore it anymore.

I've been suffering from OCD (the Scrupulosity-type) for a few years now. At first it was very mild, and I could bear wit it. However, last year, it got significantly worse. The intrusive thoughts would get into my head all the time, over any insignificant trigger, and would debilitate my for several minutes, even hours, over and over again, even having panic attacks, until I manage to brush them away or convince myself it's going to be okay.

It's even started to significantly affect my academic life, with me missing or arriving late to several of my classes, and even failing them due to missing or late work. My parents worked so hard to put me through college without any sort of college-debt, and this stupid thing is making it all for nothing and starting to seriously deter my quality in life.

A service dog for OCD?... hear me out.,"I have been to so many levels of hell within the context of OCD. Lately my compulsions cause me injuries. Okay more like this has been happening repetitively for the last two years. I am trying the ERP approach but it's very hard. People give in to me as well when they see me suffering so much. 

Does this have any merit? I know what I personally would need the dog to assist with for me. Essentially... 

1. Getting in the way and barking and causing a scene if I try engaging with a harmful compulsion. The dog would lie on top of me so keep me from getting up to complete the compulsion. If I do start to engage with it, I would like the dog to use his bark and howl as an alert to others in earshot (I don't live alone).

2. The dog would be a tool of distraction and would make me feel purposeful. This would naturally lead to less OCD battles as they are most active for me when I feel like I don't offer contributions to society. I'm physically disabled as well so am waiting to hear back from disability - I am sadly a dependent at the moment. I used to be able to work 40 hours a week and then freelance simultaneously in the field of pet care. Now that I am no longer physically able to be a regular dog walker anymore, I feel such a loss of purpose. I feel that working with a dog to make both our lives better could seriously lessen the amount of symptoms I deal with. 

3. During OCD attacks as I call them, I will not get up to take any rescue meds. If a trained dog could bring them to me when they sense I'm in too much distress to get the medication myself, that would help shorten the really bad bouts.

4. My OCD sometimes prevents me from drinking or eating properly because I get so wrapped up in compulsions or because my OCD will create an order of how things should be done and if I do not get X done first, OCD makes me feel like I cannot eat or drink yet. If a dog could give water and protein bars or the like to me periodically so I can stay hydrated and nourished, that would greatly help as well.

I'm not putting this idea into motion. Just really thought of it in detail now for the first time and I'm curious to hear your thoughts! Will cross post to a service dog subreddit.",OCD,1579729773,fuckintictacs,3,1,True,2020-01-22

I'm so embarrassed and guilty,"My thoughts are awful and in them, I enjoy those actions and I'm afraid they represent the reality. I am crying of pure sadness, not panic, at what I've become...

I have a few reasons why I could be my worse fears and I am so scared....

Self harm doesn't help anymore... I already cut myself so much and I can't stop thinking it's never enough. But I no longer suffer from the pain... Im used to it. It's not enough... Nothing is enough...

College as a trigger,"I don't know how I'm going to get through this semester, let alone the rest of college. 

When I first when to school 6 years ago (I'm 24 now), I went in while suffering from an 8-year depression. I started getting bad grades the second semester in and then withdrew (went to another school closer to home, failed out). 

Long story short, I took 2 years off of school and slowly got my life back together. Worked a few jobs, met the love of my life and had a mushroom trip that I thought had dramatically improved my OCD and definitely eliminated my depression. 

Now I'm back at the school I started at. Last semester got a 3.86, best I'd ever done in school at any point in my life. During the end of that semester though, I started to break apart. Now we're 2 weeks into spring semester and I'm already losing my mind. Anxiety and obsessions that take up several hours per day (I haven't paid attention in many of my classes so far because of this has been so severe). I've accepted that school is just a trigger for my mental illness and that I'm going to have to push through it, but I don't know if I can. It's already so fucking bad now. Yes, I did get good grades last semester but once OCD really starts to take hold it becomes impossible to concentrate on anything else, I spend most of the day completely drained, anxious, numb and angry. 

I don't know what to do. It's so painful to know that it was possible to succeed, now it feels like it's slipping away again.",OCD,1579740003,deadeyesmahone,2,1,True,2020-01-22

It takes a lot to make me *angry* but my annoyance and anxiety is near constant. I don‚Äôt want an employee or student to interpret that negativity as something directed at them.

I think I have OCD but I also think I'm an impostor,"I wrote this pretty much like an off my chest post. I've come to the point in my life where I think it's time to get diagnosed. 

I told myself for years that this didn't interfere with my life. It started out as something small and when I did mention it to a doctor, it didn't seem like a big deal to them so I thought nothing of it. 

I had my ups and downs with anxiety and depression when I was younger so I always thought there was no way I could have another mental health issue. I thought that would make it look like I was looking for attention or to look special. I didn't know much about OCD until making friends with someone who had it and then I didn't want to admit I suspected I also might have it because I didn't want to make it out to look like I was copying them for attention or sympathy. 

I have been a checker for years now but lately, leaving the house fills me with such dread, I want to call out sick and stay home and keep everything safe. I have started to turn around on some of my rides just to check to make sure a door inside the house was closed or the stove was off or all the doors were locked. 

I used to have a song that helped me close up the house and reinforced my memory that I already checked something but now I'm just repeating the words out of frustration and doubt and telling myself how crazy I sound. 

I can't keep this up. If it isn't interfering in my life, it's on its way. I'm tired of being wired the way I am. I don't know exactly when I'm going to pursue a diagnosis. I'm going to start my research into what my insurance covers first and what works in my schedule. I'm at least at the point where I'm accepting the fact that I need to speak with someone.

"Please read, HOCD obsessions and porn, feeling to lose the will to live..","I posted a thread 4 days earlier about the way my hocd started it was due to porn i think. And it started when i was 16 or something with a dude having sex with a chicken , and i got a thought that dick looks nice and got a massive anxiety rush and fear, till that day i am obsessing about the fact that i like penis. I could never watch straight porn after that and before this i didn‚Äôt really noticed the dicks in porn and was always attracted to the women, i also had many crushed on girls , and the only thing i wanted is to be with one and marry a girl and have kids, never with a man once. I had a few girlfriends i was deeply in love with and i still do with my ex girlfriend now but after all these years i think porn has really warped my sexuality.

After that incident when i was 16 i got alot of intrusive thoughts of what if youre gay 24/7 and i am checking so much, i always found gay porn disgusting and never had the desire to look it up. But when i get a thought or feeling that i like a dick or something i need to reassure myself i am not attracted and i am checking almost every single day i am attracted to it wich backfired horribly... like i said i started watching gayporn just to check it wasn‚Äôt never an interest of mine, but recently i started mastrubating to the gay content to reddit just to check and i could ejaculate and there is so much fear that is arousing or somehing? I do not know who i am anymore it so confusing and it doesn‚Äôt feel like me. Is it that porn and checking 24/7 to see i am attracted fucked up my mind so much that i am turning gay? Or was i always gay? I hadn‚Äôt had these thoughts when i don‚Äôt watch porn so it so fucking cobfusing i feel so weird and i really want to end it all i dont want to walk this road i had many OCD obsessions in my life and i was diagnosed with genrilzed anxiety disorder and intrusive thoughts but this obsessions is by far most the worst cause it feels very real and that i might become attracted to men in the future because of all the checking. It is also shamefull for me to tell this to people because the automatically think youre gay. Although i talked to my ex about it and she is always supportive. But this is such a dark lonely road i dont want to do this anymore i want to cry and i thought of commiting suicide, because i feel am losing who i am. And i lost my sexual identity.

I also check the Hocd reddit forums 24/7 to compare stories to mine. I search the internet for awnsers and i know the answer lies within myself and i know i like women very much and still do, but to see that i am now attracted to penis in porn it pains me very much it is not that i am homophobic but i just do not want it and it doesn‚Äôt satisfy me or reflect what i want. But if start to check to gayporn and shit i can get aroused and it makes me even more anxious because i never wanted to look up gay porn i just do it for the checking wich backfired horribly or am i just gay?

I watched porn from the age of 12 or something first it was straight then hardcore then lesbian, and recently gayporn but just to check i find the fucking scenes very disgusting but i keep forcing myself to watch it just to check it keeps me in such a dark circle and i am done with it because it confuses me a lot.

I really do not feel like bi or gay and i do not want to be. And i am not homophobic or something but when i watch porn i can be aroused by gay stuff and penis but it doesn‚Äôt feel god could it be that porn destroyed my brain or not? This thought is with me 24/7 and it feels like its getting worse i put so much focus on this my stamina is drained and last night i spent the whole time watching forums and checking to gayporn versus women porn and i came like 10 times. My college study is also suffering under this cause i feel like i do not want to see peope and i feel so alone in my suffering my whole libido is fucked and getting so insecure about this whole thing that i cannot experience joy anymore... i just love women and that is where i want my focus to be. But this destroyed me brothers.. i did to much checking and ruminating in my head i can‚Äôt go back anymore and what if i change it the thing i fear? 

Is there anyone with similar experience cause this things do not resonate with me in real life only in porn.. could it be that porn destroyed me ? And make me attracted to things where I wouldn‚Äôt normally be attracted to? Or i am just gay and need to accept it or is it all just the ocd cause it feels very real at this point i really need healing cause if this suffering continues i am wanting to kill myself i suffered to much in my life and i cannot enjoy it anymore porn is such fucking evil the only thing i want is to be with a girl... not with a man i say this sincere from my heart and i am 21. Could it be that porn makes you attracted to the sight of the penis cause in real life i dont want to see or touch a penis or a man at all. But the checking to gayporn and penis pictures really backfired and i just checked that to see if a got aroused and now i do wich in the end disgust me because it doesn‚Äôt feel like me.. 

Guys i really need your advice on this i am searching on the forums 24/7 to find some reassurence or something or guys who have gone to the same thing and resolved it. But the state i am now i do not want to live anymore i had many ocd obsessions and they also caused me this suicide feeling and i was going to therapy but stopped and then this came back again? Maybe because i am not healed?

I tried no fap but i cannot go even a day without mastrubating and the trigger is always first to girls and then to check to a penis to check if am aroused... i still get very aroused by women and still want to be with them very much and still have all my crushes while not on males but my head says otherwise and i always check on the streets if i find guys attractive..

There is such a fog in my brain and it feels that i am getting sexual dezentised against women because i am obessing so much of this gay stuff.

Sorry for the long post, cursing and graphical content but i really needed this of my chest because i feel i cannot overcome this and i am losing the will to live. Is there anybody that could help me or give me some advice because i am desperate for answers and i cannot even sleep because of the anxiety thoughts and guilt i feel like i am losing who i am and driving to insanity. I am even crying when typing this wtf happened to man this shit split me to the bone. Could it be low confidence? Because i was always comparing to other guys to see if they were better. And maybe its a confidence self image issue maybe i feel i do not deserve love and condemn myself. I also get insecure when i see people with bigger dicks mine is average/big but still get thoughs that i have a tiny dick could it be from to much porn?? Or is that i am missing masculine energy because of the many mastrubation and obsessing over the fact that i am gay wich results in a low libido, i read alot of stories on the forums and the coming out stories frighten me alot not because i am supressing shit but the fear that i will eventually turn gay due to the porn arousal or something. And i don‚Äôt even find mens bodies arousing at all i could only get aroused when seeing the penis but not a enjoyable arousel more like fear and disgust and that makes it more arousing i think idk.. before the porn incident i didnt find penisis attracting and i still do not but i can get off to it when i am checking to see if am aroused. But in real life I wouldn‚Äôt even want to be a near a penis and i don‚Äôt crave or want it, its just when the penis comes in porn and fucks the women its arousing, is it because the penis is a symbol for pleassure that my brains associated that with pleasure i read that also in the forums, or i am thinking way to much and just stop obessing and stop porn and mastrubation and checking and will my old attractions come back or is not porn induced?? And for the note i do not see myself romantical with a man in any way shape or form, i always loved women as long as i remembered, so is it hocd porn induced or not?

Does anyone experience or had experienced obsessive thoughts about having serious mental illnesses?,"Hello. So I finally got the courage to write something basically anywhere on the Internet (I'm forcing myself to, because I'm trying to get out of the comfort zone). 
I don't want to make this long so I'll just shorten it as much as I can.
Basically, I'm the dude who experienced almost every major type of OCD (except relationship OCD, because I'm not really interested in relationships yet).
So, if I had to say what fked me up the hardest, I would tell you it was POCD, just because I had no idea what the hell happened. But if I had to say what is the biggest pain in the ass, which follows me for about 2 years, for me, it's the type of obsessive thoughts related to serious mental illnesses (such as being hypomanic, being schizophrenic, being borderline... you name it) - I have seen just a few people speaking about this. Not to misunderstand me, after being a while on antidepressants and olanzapines (I couldn't sleep at nights because of severe anxiety and was depressed, frustrated etc) my state really improved, but since I became meds-free (a few days ago) the fear of being hypomanic just came back.
So how does this type of thoughts feels like and what does trigger them? As an example, you are on vacation and you do not feel like sleeping so you stay browsing the Internet very late (for me it's about 4-5 am), which is not rare for young people, someone who is afraid of hypomania or mania etc will get a thought that they are hypomanic or whatever. In that situation, when you try to sleep, you will get bunch of random dumb thoughts which lead to anxiety and keep you awake. Also, being with others used to trigger my fear of BPD, but not anymore. I was afraid of being schizophrenic and was constantly thinking about hallucinations but that went by quickly.
So I just wanted to write this to hear some experiences and make the ones with the same problems less alone.
I would also like to hear some experiences about the ones who got off the olanzapines - how long do the withdrawal symptoms last? 

Also I am being very honest with you that OCD is really fked up but be sure that you can beat it, just like I got 90% off of my back since I went on therapies. The key is SELF-GROWTH. Hell I even wanted to kill myself, and was close to it.

What ERP would work for this Pure O?,"I have that weird OCD that revolves around ""being judged"" or ""failing"" anything I do at the moment when the thought kicks in, it developed when I was in school, for example when I was taking a big exam, reading something in front of a class, talking with people while others were listening, I was anxious I was being judged. It basically works like that:

1) I am in a good mood, talk to someone, present something in front of a group

2) A thought pops up ""what if I fuck something up, what if THAT state of depersonalisation starts again (caused by anxiety itself!!!)

3) I shit my pants ""holy fuck this CANNOT happen right now because Im in the middle of a presentation.

4) Guess what, derealisation KICKS IN, anxiety KICKS IN, I want to hide, my mind starts racing, I start panicking

It lasts for a few hours, untill I go to sleep or drink a small dose of alcohol.

I started taking SSRI (Escitalopram) a month ago, I also started a therapy. What ERP would work for my obsession? It's really weird, sometimes it starts when I just think about it, doing nothng or playing video games, sometimes I want to fail purposefuly just to make it go away and prove that I'm insane, I lose any interest in anything I'm doing when it comes.

Schizophrenia fear is back once again,"I‚Äôve been doing well with this fear for the most part. It all came rushing back today. 

My visual disturbances are what sparked my whole fear, and they seem to be getting a bit worse. 

They are:
- excessive floaters that I noticed 2 years ago
- flashing dots and lights 
- afterimages 

Ones that started recently (after my fear of schizophrenia started):
- seeing starbursts and halos
- certain objects look like they‚Äôre expanding/‚Äúbreathing‚Äù 

this last one is the one that freaks me out to no end. I read a few times that growing and shrinking objects were one of the first signs of schizophrenia. I noticed this one a couple months ago and it freaked me out first but then I got over it. Now I started thinking about it again and paired with my other symptoms, I‚Äôm convinced it‚Äôs the beginning of psychosis. 

I‚Äôve gotten an eye exam last summer about this and I have perfect vision. I keep hoping that maybe I have some medical issue like a sinus thing that might be the cause. Or even my migraines. Honestly, and I know how fucked up this sounds, I would love to find out that a Brain tumor is causing all this. That‚Äôs how scared of it I am.

I think I have POCD and other kinds of OCD as well. Please respond. This is the first time I've talked about some of this.,"This is the first time I've ever talked to anyone, anonymously or face to face, about this. I don't know if you'll be able to help me. I don't know if looking for others who might understand any of this is just another form of ""reassurance-seeking."" FYI, I am a mid20s man.

I have POCD.  I want information about POCD and how to recover from it. I think that it began when I read stories about child predators in churches. This was about five years ago. I started thinking about the things I had read a lot. I ruminate a lot about POCD.

I also think I have Harm OCD. I'm terrified that my actions might lead to harm. I think all the time about moral responsibility. I didn't donate to a charity. That means people might have died, and I could have prevented it. I want to write an exciting book, but I don't want any real-world violence to be inspired by it. I could go on. 

I'm always thinking about whether I've committed sexual harassment. I move away from women in crowds. I don't let my crotch area point toward them. When a woman cashier hands me change I try not to touch their hands. When I was 12 years old, I did something that might have been sexual harassment. I think all the time about whether it was bad, how bad it was, whether I should tell others about it so they know how bad I am. I've talked to therapists about this one before, but not POCD. I think that this started when #metoo became part of the news. If I have harmed women, it would be right for me to be humiliated and shamed. This is why I always think about this, because the stakes are high.

I have also had religious OCD about making promises to God. This only happened recently. I found myself making a mental promise to God that I would never write again. I love to write. Apparently, OCD can make you do things like that, which is what I tell myself when I think about that incident. I don't know if this is connected with religious doubts I've been having recently.

I think I've had some form of OCD for a very long time. I have always been morally exacting about myself. I thought of myself as ""bad"" a lot of the time. I believed, and still do, that an evil action by me would be deserving of absolutely no pity and should be punished. If I tried to stop worrying about what I'm afraid of, then I would introduce the possibility of an evil person escaping punishment. I can't risk ""accepting myself"" or ""forgiving myself"" because evil actions deserve no forgiveness. I have done many things that are definitely bad and wrong. This gets mixed in with OCD fears and makes everything confusing. 

Sometimes it seems like I'm better, but then I spend a long time going over past events and thoughts and trying to make sure. I've been to therapy, but a lot of time, other issues, like more general life stresses, were involved. I haven't brought up the severe OCD, like pOCD, to a therapist because I'm not sure they would even know what it is.  I've heard stories about that.

There's more things I'd like advice and help on, but this post is long already and I don't know what responses I'll get.",OCD,1579807990,AnonymousOCDaccount,5,1,True,2020-01-23

"I am not sure what to think anymore, its all so confusing and I am about to give up","Hey all,

I hope you're all doing very well today, I found out about this subreddit some weeks ago and I was really glad to find out that there was a subreddit dedicated to it (even though I am not so sure if its ocd anymore and that eats me up for so long)

I just want to get this off my chest because as of late my ocd (atleast I assume) is getting much than few weeks before and thats likely because well, the non stop reassurance seeking to myself and others as well trying to fight these thoughts with my own thoughts, which makes it a whole mess to begin with and now I am confused with myself and I don't know whats real or not. 

Is it truly OCD? Or am I just simply in denial?

I really want to know if its possible for obsessions to ''morph'' together. Lets say, is it possible to have a sexual intrusive thought based on a real event you did before and now deeply regret? It probably sounds really confusing and I understand that perfectly. I am just dealing with so much pain and shame from what I have done in the past and I cannot stand myself from what I did (mostly very weird things I did as a child like obsessing about a specific thing) And now I just feel horrible and disgusted that I did it, yet, my brain claims that its a sign that I still want to do it while I absolutely depise and loath the idea of doing it and thinking about it once more.

I always had an issue with letting go of the past, especially with mistakes. From the very moment it was brought back up I was terrified, because they just disgust me so much and I absolutely despise the idea because its just wrong to me. I usually try to ''correct'' these thoughts or pinch/hit myself. I don't know if its normal or not and thats where the denial part comes from, whenever I try to avoid it and do my thing, my mind goes like ''You do not dislike it you actually like it you are just hiding it'' which as a result makes me very upset as a result because I feel ashamed and disgusted about my past mistakes and I feel like its coming back to bite me. 

For the majority of my day nowadays I non stop tell myself ''I don't have to do the same thing I did in the past. I was just a child, let it go, it doesn't mean I have to do it now or still have to like it because I really don't want to do it again'' continiously. And then that one thought slips up saying ''I shouldn't be scared I don't have to dislike it'' and it just..oh my god why are you there It makes me doubt myself like who is me and what isn't? Am I just in denial?

It makes me question my morals and standards and I miss the times I didn't think about them. Its kind of weird considering I wasn't really happy during that time but atleast I didn't think about that thing ever again. Am I just fighting myself? It just feels so wrong and disgusting now. 

I get so much anxiety in my chest whenever I fight back at it and it really makes me question everything about myself in that matter. No matter what it is I always check myself to make sure if I didn't feel this, or that. Its torture to be honest, but just the fact I had an obsession as a child back when I did ''like'' it before makes it so much tough to deal with it. I feel horrible for the things I have done but I feel like I cannot change it? I don't want it to be a part of me, I don't consider it to be a part of me, why can't I just let things go?

I have been dealing with it since October (And I know there are always people who have it worse than me) and as I probably have stated a couple of times before, I feel so lost sometimes. I don't know what to think or feel and I cannot enjoy things like I used to because I am scared of that thought slipping up once more, or that memory. Its like non stop monitoring my brain. I also got really sensitive towards my surroundings. I know its a very long post, but I had to get it off my chest because I cannot take it anymore.

Fear of Food Allergies (Despite not having any!),"Hello everyone. I‚Äôm a senior in HS who has struggled with OCD since I was a child. My OCD didn‚Äôt get severe until I was in the 8th grade.

I‚Äôve never been allergic to any of these and I usually eat almonds on the daily, but lately I‚Äôve been avoiding these things. It‚Äôs so difficult and I think about it everyday.

I have obsessive thoughts that my boyfriend is secretly gay,"Ive had this about any boyfriend Ive ever had. I know its not rational. Yet I still obsess over it. I get intrusive thoughts that he cheats on me with his male friends, and have affairs behind my back.
I awhile back saw he watches alot of analporn and trans porn. I know its not gay porn, I know it doesnt make any sense, but the fact that there are two penises involved has made my thoughts so much worse. Ive known this for a long time but its only over the last 6 months that my head have started to fill up with it.
When we have sex I get thoughts in my head that he pretends Im a man, and thats why he likes analsex. Now my thoughts have envolved to that he must only want to be with me because I look like a man, and its effecting my own view on my body. That Im not feminine and other people think I look like a man.

I dont want to shame him in any way, which Im afraid I will do if I talk about it because it might sound like its coming from a place of sexual judgement or homophobia. I promise it really is not, I am not in anyway judgemental against different sexes or sexual orientations and I feel very strongly against people who do but I understand how people would see this. Im writing it in this forum with hope that you understand the unrational part of it.

"Abandonment fear, help!","Hello, thank-you for taking the time to read this!
I'm really hoping to get some insight on this topic. 

I find that one of my fears is cheating ( being cheated on/ cheating on my partner ). I strongly believe this stems from a fear of abandonment ( I was adopted at 2 months old ).

I find that I feel guilty for getting excited about talking to an attractive guy, enjoying the conversation, looking forward to talking to them.
I have a gay ( male ) friend who I'm really close to although we've distanced ourselves a bit. We've had intimate connections and partied a lot in the past . He messaged me today and I got excited to talk to him and then the chain reaction began . I feel excited to talk to a close friend that I've had an intimate connection with -&gt; this must mean I want to break up with my bf . Seems like I've got an all or nothing thought process here. My friend is 1. Unavailable and 2. Gay . We've kissed and had intimate conversations together so I feel like I'm cheating by talking to him . Which isn't true .
I fear that I'm my boyfriend or myself is going to fall in love with someone else and leave .
I get intrusive visions of him cheating on me and me cheating on him. It's incredibly overwhelming and triggers my obsession ( wanting to look through his messages and breaking our trust/privacy )

Anyways I'd love to understand why people feel physically and mentally attracted to others even when in a relationship. I feel that I would have less fear about intimacy between others if I educated myself. I really want to move past my fear of being cheated on and cheating on my partner. I feel like my fear is holding me back from creating new connections with others and making friends.

If anyone has any way of providing insight or sharing some scientific articles that would be amazing!

Randomly No Appetite??,"Not sure if this is linked to OCD/anxiety/depression or is just something that happens but... I'm someone who normally eats A LOT.

Have I been avoiding a diagnosis or just coping really well?,"Hey guys, first time poster on this sub. I figured out I had ocd a long time ago, probably when I was about 11 or 12 however I have had it much longer than that. I have never gotten diagnosed or even checked for it. My mom doesn‚Äôt believe in this stuff and I suffered through a lot of anxiety and panic attacks in my childhood (especially around my high school years) all without help. Eventually I kind of learned to cope with it. I had my second baby in August 2018 and in October 2018 I got an iud, this changed my moods 100% (the iud totally changed me). I ended up trying to get help at my doctors office and was sent to see a counselor. When we talked she said that I did have a lot of anxiety but that I knew how to handle it and cope. I will say when I have panic attacks I‚Äôve learned how to control them (my breathing especially).      

Lately I‚Äôve been having a lot of financial trouble and my anxiety is through the roof. I am panting all day long and am struggling to catch my breathe. Luckily I haven‚Äôt had a full blown attack yet but I can‚Äôt continue like this. I want to go back to the counselor and get some help but I do remember part of me didn‚Äôt want the counselor to know how much I suffer (although I was open to having my issues validated).     

I keep thinking about the one opportunity I had to really get help and I am unsure if she was just not equipped to help or if I downplayed my issues so not to get diagnosed. Honestly part of me doesn‚Äôt want the diagnoses because I‚Äôm afraid one day it will be used against me somehow. I do want some kind of help though, I‚Äôve struggled with this my whole life and it sucks. I know it‚Äôs mental but eventually it manifests into something physical (I‚Äôve had chronic diarrhea, constant panic attacks, etc) and I just want some help.

Feeling really awful...,"The last few days have been hard. My anxiety is currently high as I write this.

For the past six months I‚Äôve been having a flare of my OCD. It first came in the form of schizophrenia fears, psychosis fears, fears about losing my mind in general. But those fears slowly morphed into other fears and I realised how rapidly my fears were changing. But I was able to put my finger on exactly what the thought was that was scaring me... until one day I had a thought like ‚Äúwhat if you begin to fear something you can‚Äôt actually figure out‚Äù - this one floored me. Because until then I hadn‚Äôt really had a problem figuring out my fears. I knew the things I feared were schizophrenia, psychosis, etc... but this new fear hit me like a tonne of bricks. It suggested something inescapable. And for the past 2 months now I‚Äôve been wrecking my head TRYING to figure it out. Trying to fine tune my thought process when the obsessive fear occurs so I can start tackling it but the problem is I can‚Äôt really wrap my head around what is it that‚Äôs scaring me.  It seems too abstract. It‚Äôs more of a feeling. If that makes sense?

The way it comes on me is kinda like... thing huge crushing sense of dread, and then I go into my compulsions. It has taken me a while to figure out my compulsions but I think i know most of them now.

1. I research (google) treatment options ALOT
2. I head to reddit to post 
3. I try to rationalise my thoughts. For example, I will tell myself things like ‚Äúthese are just thoughts, everything will be fine‚Äù... pfft.
4. I try to use logic to beat the feeling away.

And I‚Äôm not sure if this ones a compulsion but I also think a lot about when I didn‚Äôt have OCD and compare it to the present moment when I do. I guess it‚Äôs less of a compulsion and more maybe just a desire to be without this horrible disorder again. Who knows.

Anyway, I‚Äôve been in the basic OCD loop. I have a thought &gt; which spikes a feeling (anxiety, dread) &gt; which then has me perform a compulsion &gt; repeat. 

My main issue with my thoughts right now is that they‚Äôre telling me I will never get better if I can‚Äôt figure out what exactly is scaring me. This makes sense. Except I don‚Äôt think there is anything scaring me other than that thought itself. It all seems so obscure and mental. Which then makes me panic more because it literally sounds so mental. (WARNING: POTENTIALLY TRIGGERING) Ultimately I think my fear lies in never getting better and therefore ending up committing suicide. I don‚Äôt want to kill my self but that‚Äôs where this thought process is leading me.

The health care in my country is going to shit. Especially the mental health sector so unfortunately I‚Äôve had to look into self help options for my OCD as opposed to real treatment options. I have tried meds but they have too many side effects for me to cope with. 

I‚Äôm trying to implicate strategies I‚Äôve read about but I‚Äôm failing pretty miserably. In the process I‚Äôm boggling my mind and getting very overwhelmed. 

I‚Äôve also thought maybe I‚Äôm obsessing about obsessing. Or maybe I‚Äôm simply obsessing over fear. I just can‚Äôt figure it out. It‚Äôs so frustrating. There are moments where I just wish I could not care about it. I realise it‚Äôs an irrelevant thought and serves no purpose yet the fear is very real and it gives the thought a real presence.

She also lied and said i don't help, when luckily, i brought this up to my coworkers and they immediately jumped to my defense and said I'm one of the most helpful people there and will vouch for me to my boss. I was also told by a couple people she is badmouthing me behind my back. My boss seems to know she doesn't do well with directness from certain people but will jump to her defense every time, and downplayed her being super rude to me. 

Anyway, I decided to switch to a better staffed floor. However, I have to work with this girl two more times and as an extremely anxious person, I am terrified about what is going to happen when I work with her. I can't imagine why things would get very bad, but she is a liar and unpredicatable, and I am obviously on her shit list. 

I have let this get to me and am paralyzed by anxiety about this. I have a hard time leaving the apartment and doing anything other than sitting or lying around and watching tv or playing on my phone. I know I would feel better if I exercised but I feel so anxious I can't leave the house or let myself be happy. What the hell! I normally enjoy being active and healthy.

I hate this about myself. I'm on meds (i probably need the dosage increased) and have gone to counseling on and off for nearly 6 years. This situation at work and the impending sense of doom anxiety about it is causing me to neglect self care in a big way. I wouldn't even shower for a few days. My eyebrows look horrible.

Why you get intrusive thoughts/urges/etc,"Currently going through a relapse, but I feel qualified to post this since I actually got to what I consider 100% recovery over the summer which lasted from July - October, but I relapsed due to stress from dating and a girl breaking up with me.  


The reason that we all get these intrusive thoughts/urges/etc is because our brains think they're helping us as a result of how WE have trained them.  Imagine if you were in war, or a tiger was chasing you in a jungle, or if you were in the middle of a natural disaster...you were react to these events with INTENSE fear (just like we all have with our themes).  Your brain would pick up on how much focus, attention, and emotional energy was consumed due to these scenarios.  Your brain would start throwing up random ""what if"" scenarios in order to make sure that you were ready for anything and everything, and it would only stop throwing up these ""what if"" scenarios once the event was over (ie: you are back home and no longer in war, you've escaped or killed the tiger, the natural disaster has finished).   Our brains doing this in those situations would be extremely beneficial and make it more likely for us to survive whatever was thrown our way. However, since our fears are all theoretical in nature, the ""events"" never end, we're always in it.    


The only way to escape the mental torment is to retrain our brains that there is no danger, and that whatever it is viewing as a threat should be of no concern.  This is a process but once your brain understands this it will move on.  It likely will try to move on to a new theme right away but if you can retrain your reactive behavior to thoughts they will appear less and less frequently.  Once you master this you'll have such little care about them that it will seem as if you don't have them at all.  I'm assuming if I didn't relapse eventually the thoughts would stop coming all together but honestly where I was at was blissful peace so I just want to encourage everyone that you can and will be at peace if you do what you are supposed to when it comes to overcoming your OCD!",OCD,1576801562,Astrothunderr,0,1,True,2019-12-19
There is hope,"Hi, I just want to update and let everyone know there is hope.
I am a mom with ocd about lead exposure in my little ones.
I did therapy with psych , took an SSRI to take the edge off anxiety and depression (not at high enough dose for OCD) and open up to my husband about my worries etc that are not OCD. I also learn to not be perfect all the time. Risk taking is still hard which is weird as I am in a profession where uncertainty rules the day.
After an arduous long year I am feeling hopeful and more myself. Compulsion has lessened. I am not googling all day about lead or worried there is lead is EVeRYthing. Of course I know if there is a real danger I will avoid it for my kids or do things the lead safe way. But my irrational beahviours have really improved
I hope it last.

Advice on flying by myself (first time). I get very panicky and have constant negative thoughts.,"I am flying alone for the first time soon. Flying has always caused anxiety in myself but at least I always had someone else there with me. This would put me at ease (somewhat).

Now I'm really trying not to think about everything that could go wrong when I'm flying by myself. The flight is 2hrs 30mins long. I am not claustrophobic but I tend to get the real panicky when there is a lot of people around(crowds). Even during bus commutes, panic seeps into me. At a bus I can get off and wait for the next one to come (avoid rush hours). But i am going to be a plane. I cant exactly just hop off and wait for the next flight.
I am 19F and look a lot younger than my age. I could easily pass as a 15 year old. I dont wear any make up nor have I ever (with the exception of special occasions). I worry that the security at the airport might look at me suspicious. A young girl travelling by herself. All of this anxiety is building up inside of me and I'm really trying not to freak the fuck out because I don't want to avoid flying completely because of this anxiety. I want to travel and live my life.

I get heart palpitations and feelings as if my throat is closing or like I'm struggling to breath. This worsens when there is distress on the craft. I will never forget this one time I was on a flight that was 3hrs 30mins long. This toddler wouldn't stop crying and the mother was yelling and the other lady (maybe the mothers sister, idk) was trying to calm the toddler down too. The man I was sitting next to was laughing at the situation (later i realised he knew them). This made me really uncomfortable (well because what funny about that??). Now they were speaking a language that I didn't know (Not knowing what was being said from mother to toddler made me feel further uneasy). I started to imagine what abuse the mother might be saying to the toddler. (I always think of the worst). I felt like just getting off the plane. I understand that kids cry on planes and can get distressed but this incident was just before take off and still continued another 40mins into the flight. I was actually blocking my ears in an attempt to ""escape"" the scenario. I got this sudden cold feeling wash over my body as if something really bad is going to happen. Eventually the toddler quieted down but the panic I felt that day was the worse i have ever felt. I had my partner sitting next to me who helped me through this.

I am so scared that something like this could happen on the flight and I really dont know if i can handled another distressing situation like the one i explained above. What if it's worse?? What if something really bad happens to the plane. If someone goes into labour or something while mid flight. I am aware that all of these thing are unlikely to happen but I cant stop thinking about the what ifs. I am flying out to my partner.

Advice on how I could slow down the heart palpitations would much appreciated. Or how I could just get through 2hrs 30mins of not panicking. How can I get my heart rate and thoughts to just chill the fuck out. I was thinking of sleep depriving myself a few days before I fly out so I would just sleep through the flight. I know this isn't a great idea.",OCD,1576802281,soapyfire,15,1,True,2019-12-19

Classic anxious loop,"I get so disheartened by myself everytime certain words trigger me. If someone even slightly finds something I have said, done, etc. To be annoying, I can't NOT focus on it. It feels like a spiral of my emotions and then my brain reminds me of every time I've ever annoyed anyone and then I end up crying or being awful to myself. I already constantly feel like a nussiance to the people I care about in my life (even if I know and remind myself that's not true), when someone voices my fears to be reality my brain just latches on to that and aggressive rubs my nose in the evidence of me being annoying. I have a really hard time communicating when something has hurt me too because I heavily fear the confrontation and worry that what I'm fretting over isn't actually serious and is just me fixating on things that don't matter. But even if they do matter and are really important, I can't vocalize it. I choke up and can't stand up for myself ever. It drives me crazy.

Tired of these bad intrusive thoughts,"I was watching a recommended video on YouTube of a person reacting to bad tiktoks of my country. I needed to laugh a bit but I regret it. One tik tok appeared of a girl - she was probably 14, 15 (she had her face hidden) and until the video started I had no idea what was happening. She started slowly opening her jacket to reveal her chest but the video stopped immediately before she revealed anything. It was on purpose, just to tease the viewers... I don't know if I had intrusive thoughts but I have the feeling that I ""wanted"" to see more and I immediately got in panic. And I feel horrible and I can't handle my head anymore....

And now I'm terrified that I could have had these bad thoughts in the past when I saw something inappropriate and I fear that I didn't dismissed and that I secretly wanted more without realizing it was bad. I just.... I feel awful... I don't know what to do... I wish I hadn't been such an awful person in the past...

I keep looking back for some kind of evidence that I did bad things and I believe I did and I just don't remember...

I hate this feeling of guilt always in my head and I can't turn it off...

I am constantly afraid I was deviant in the past or had inapropriate thoughts that were wrong and I was aware and even if I was unaware, I deeply regret them...

Like a game of whack-a-mole,"I've made amazing headway with my usual contamination obsessions but I've noticed obsessive thought patterns popping up elsewhere in my life. So a little backstory... I've been with my boyfriend for almost three years now and ever since the beginning and still now, I'm convinced he is the person I will spend the rest of my life with. I love him dearly and I only want to be with him.

 But suddenly I've become obsessed with male attention. I have no intention of ever pursuing other men and I find the idea of being intimate with anyone else disturbing. But I've had these intrusive thoughts centered around other men being attracted to me and before I know it I find myself engaged in light flirting at work. When I return home and review the day I realize how awful of a person that makes me. I've never cheated on a significant other and I never will but there seems to be no way to cull the thoughts I have about wanting other men to be attracted to me even though I am not attracted to them. 

Could my obsessive thoughts be displaced from contamination to relationship OCD? I feel so guilty for even thinking about other men being attracted to me.

"I'm really scared I'm a sociopath or a narcissist, please help!","I'm aware of how this sounds/seems, but I've been to probably 9-10 different therapists/psychiatrists over the past year and a half to make sure I'm not a sociopath, I thought I was 'over' it but now it's come back again and I'm terrified that I have NPD - to the point where it affects everything that I do, and I feel like I've actually lost my 'personality' or whatever personality I had before these fears started. 

I've spent hours and hours researching narcissism and sociopathy, and I KNOW that it stresses me out and scares me, and I do it to make sure I'm not but all I do is convince myself that I might be. 

I've spent a year and a half 'watching' and analyzing every emotional reaction I have to make sure it's okay. And then even when I do feel guilty for something, or think I have empathy, I worry that I'm just convincing myself that I have both of those because sociopaths/narcissists aren't aware of themselves. My dad passed away a few years ago and it took me awhile to process it, and when I've found myself crying - even then, I can't just be sad. I worry that I only miss him for selfish reasons or that I don't actually miss HIM, that I miss that he'd help me out financially sometimes, which would make me a parasite (and parasitic living is on the list for ASPD), and I DO get help from my mom sometimes because I'm in grad school (I can't even type that without worrying that it means I'm trying to brag). 

Even if I do something nice for someone, I'm scared that I'm just trying to manipulate them somehow, or that I'm just trying to get attention/narcissistic supply. I worry what my supervisors think of me, and what people think of me in general - and that in turn makes me worry that I'm a narcissist, but then if I can convince myself not to care what people think, then I'm a sociopath. I can't win. 

I recently got into an argument with a friend, and we're not talking at the moment, and rationally - I think I was right, not in all ways, not completely and I can see where I did go wrong, but I think my hurt feelings about her consistently flaking out on plans/not putting effort into the friendship were valid. I did apologize for the way I approached it. But what if I'm just unable to empathize or set unrealistic expectations of people? What if I convince myself that I'm able to apologize because I'm just that big of a narcissist, and I know that's what looks good to other people but I'm not actually sorry? I think I was? Or what if by standing up for myself, or trying to end a friendship, I devalued her? I know I still care about her, rationally, it wasn't healthy - but why doesn't that make all of the other fears go away? 

I feel like I'm losing my mind and essentially gaslighting myself. Please help.",OCD,1576818054,crimgirl87,3,1,True,2019-12-20

Is this OCD or just anxiety?,"So first of all, I despise self diagnosing and no matter what I won't say i have OCD until my therapists diagnoses it.

I am diagnosed with GAD but i think i might have OCD too. I wanna go over some pf the things i do and just ask if this sounds like it or could just be major anxiety.

-I have several routines and routes I have to go. (one full round around the couch nefore i go to bed and pressing my legs two times at s√∂ecific angles on the couch, if i do something wrong i have to do it again. i then have to close the door with my left elbow.)

-some things have to be exactly there. 
(when i feed my cat her can of food has to stand exactly there in the fridge and i have to tap it multiple times. I have to pet her multiple times and her food bowl has to be in the exact placement.) Other than a few of those kinda things tho I'm not organized (?) at all and love having my room messy that's why i don't know :/

-feeling like it's my fault when something happens to someone else. 
(I hate being responsible for how others peoples days go so i for example often don't send a text cause their day would be a tad different and they could get run over just because they went for a walk a minute too late because of m. Stuff like that.)

-At the moment I can't deinstall apps or i feel like something bad could happen. My poor phone.

-Have to tap things this or that long.

I'm aure i forgot something but it's always ""if you don't do that this bad thing is gonna happen to you""

Helpful info for people with OCD contamination phobia relating to soap/detergent,"I could go into great detail but I just wanted to quickly let people know how to deal with soap/detergent residue etc. Methylated Spirits (Denatured Alcohol) is perfect for obliterating soap! It also eats away at foam bubbles. Spray on a paper towel and wipe the object and then if you want rinse it. Isopropyl alcohol is another chemical but it is really expensive (in Australia at least). I don't want to enable anyone to use this to make their OCD/phobia get worse but I hope this makes things easier when you have an accident/contamination. Also Vinegar is another great chemical. 

PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU DON'T USE ALCOHOL ON PAINTED SURFACES.


Also yes we have to clean ourselves in the shower but did you know that cleaning wipes/sprays that use benzalkonium chloride are soap and detergent free and contain no foaming agents! They still are a surfactant but they don't hang around and rinse off like instantly and you will see the bubbles break down very quickly. Any benzalkonium chloride residue left hanging around will NOT bubble up again so it's a suitable replacement for people with a soap/detergent phobia.

It‚Äôs written in numerous places that the virus ‚Äúdies‚Äù fast outside the body, yet a few sources say it takes 6 days!! Now thanks to this fear, I‚Äôm more likely to avoid public restrooms, be super careful about what I touch, and engage in any rituals that I believe would reduce any risk.

I've realized my eating disorder as an adolescent was related to OCD.,"Does anyone relate to realizing their OCD and eating disorder were connected? What was having an eating disorder like for you, if you had one? Did you feel your eating disorder was somehow a bit different than the experience of others who did not have OCD?

I couldn't figure out how I suddenly developed all these things I had to do related to food and weight, and became obsessed with eating a certain number of calories, even cutting my food a certain way, compulsively exercising and weighing myself to make sure I didn't gain weight. I knew I had a problem, didn't think I needed to lose any more weight, but also couldn't stop the whole thing. I felt like a poser when hospitalized, because I knew I had a problem and didn't see myself as ""fat"", so I just felt like everyone else was sick and I must have just done it for attention or was acting the whole time and just took it too far. I was so ashamed that I didn't even explain all of that to any mental health professional and had to mostly recover on my own through what I now understand was exposure therapy. I had to stop weighing myself and checking calories and sit with the uncertainty. I had to deal with the uncomfortable feeling of gaining back weight and wondering if I was ""fat"". However, it worked, and that leaves me hopeful ERP will work for me for other things now. I don't check calories and really only weigh myself a few times a year and at the doctor's office, because I don't feel a need to know. Realizing I have OCD and this was related has let me understand my brain and how it works in a new way. I used to just think I was faking my issues or it was a lack of willpower or something.

Hi everyone,
I‚Äôve been struggling for about 10 years now with OCD‚ÄîI‚Äôm 23 now. My OCD involves counting and checking, primarily around hand washing and accidental harm or contamination. I‚Äôm really struggling with stopping myself from checking things, for example I‚Äôm taking PreP and I have to check hundreds of times if my meds are closed and search the floor for dropped pills because I‚Äôm worried my pet will get to it. Also, I can wash my hands for 20 minutes at a time, counting 1, 2, or 1, 1,2, (I don‚Äôt know why). My fear with this is that I have soap on my hands and I am going to touch my face or something and go blind or sick. I have an appointment with a psychiatrist after Christmas who will put me on an SSRI and I hope this helps but in the meantime how can I help myself to stop with these compulsions, it‚Äôs so exhausting to constantly check and still feel no relief. On top of this, I have the flu right now so performing OCD compulsions is even more tiring. Thanks if you read the whole way.

I've been prescribed a lot of medicines for past anxieties, specifically panic attacks and severe health anxiety but I've only ever taken by choice, the as needed pill called Alprazolam (Xanax) for when I have panic attacks.

 I was wondering if I took this would this help me clear my anxieties while I write?

Struggling Hard,"Hi guys. I need some advice. 

So since the spring of last year, (I can remember the specific day) I have been obsessing over the same thought pattern. I am almost to the point where I don‚Äôt know what to do. 

Basically when I was a bit younger (I‚Äôm 22 now) I used to look at a lot of rule 34 stuff. Sometimes weird, yes. I also would read pretty explicit fan fiction. I thought it was better than real porn cause it wasn‚Äôt exploiting anyone. Until ... I realized that some of the characters were like technically underage cartoon characters. And then I realized it‚Äôs illegal to receive those over the internet because it violates federal obscenity laws. And there started my nightmare. 

I have developed physical rituals because of these thoughts. I have been close to harming myself. I am so disgusted by the idea of being a pedophile, but I‚Äôm even more scared of being arrested and imprisoned for these mistakes. How can I focus on my real life when it could all be taken from me any day now?

I‚Äôve told my therapist, who worked with sex offenders previously. He told me he wouldn‚Äôt have to report it, and he didn‚Äôt think I had anything to go to the police about. I also posted in legal advice a while ago, and a mod who says he‚Äôs on a cyber crimes task force said it‚Äôs essentially never prosecuted. I‚Äôve even talked to my MOM and BF about this. Super embarrassing. 

But none of this changes that I know I must have broken the law, even though I didn‚Äôt mean harm. I font know what to do. I‚Äôm on medication and I‚Äôm trying therapy and I‚Äôve confessed.

"I might not realize how bad my OCD is, do any of you experience these types of symptoms and are they even symptoms?","I'll flair this because it *may* be triggering, but I honestly may not realize how bad this condition of mine is. So settle in for some details if you care to listen.

A decent part of my childhood was spent as sort of a mediocre hypochondriac. And I don't mean that to be offensive or take hypochondria lightly - it's probably not even the best way of describing what I'm talking about. Let me give you a couple examples: When I was bored by school, I'd do anything I could to convince myself I was sick. Turns out I was just probably a quick learner and needed to be more challenged. When I thought glasses looked cool, I faked my eye exams. Turns out I actually had really bad vision. I even tried really hard to get braces because I just wanted to have them. It all seems silly now, but I was an only child being raised by a single mother, so I guess I just wanted the attention. But all of these examples share a theme: I faked a health issue or disability and it turns out it would be symptomatic of something else, or - I would *actually* have the health issue.

So when OCD was discussed in health or talked about lightly as some sort of ""super power for organization"", I began to look in to it. And, mind you, this was when I was about 12 and starting to develop some serious mental health issues. So I read the book, ""*Kissing Doorknobs""*. Now, I'm sure many of you have heard of that particular work of fiction accompanied by a doctor's note and disclaimer, but it had me convinced that I had OCD. So what did I do? I told mental health staff that I had OCD because, you know, I'd organize DVD's and books or I'd avoid walking on floor patterns a certain way or I'd count steps and it *really* interfered with my daily life. It didn't.

But there was some truth to my claims. No, I didn't occupy my mind with organization or compulsive counting, rather - I'd experience thoughts that were inescapable. ""Are those kids laughing at me?"", ""Am I unappreciated by everyone? A joke?"", ""When that girl called me annoying, does everyone think that *always?* Am I just annoying to everyone?"" and so on. And these thoughts were **loud** in my head. And I couldn't stop thinking about them no matter how hard I tried. If I got teased, I'd think about it for months. If I got into a fight or bullied, months if not years. I would think about it going to sleep, when I was under-stimulated, or when there was nothing else to think about. There are events that happened to me 15+ years ago that I still think about and am like, ""That was really awkward. I bet I looked super stupid doing that. What an odd thing to do/say"".

Now, doctors and therapists are smart, so when I exaggerated OCD symptoms like organizing and counting, they could probably see through the ""lies"" and most likely assumed I was seeking attention. Eventually, they came to the conclusion that I had MDD and GAD. Also, in my early twenties, I was convinced I had ADD even though I just primarily wanted the pills for studying. Turns out, ADD was the reason I couldn't study well because I'd drift off when I'd read or sit in lectures (almost immediately) and wouldn't retain anything. Or I'd think too long about one subject when it was time to move on to another. So the ADD medication actually has a purpose now instead of just being a study aid. It makes me more motivated to do things and, when I do, I actually pay close attention and retain information much better. 

But here's something that I've experienced my *whole* life and thought was just a preference. The topic of my post. Cringeworthy and awkward situations on TV and in real life. I CAN NOT HANDLE THEM. 

It's to the point where a Ben Stiller - Meet the Parents style movie makes me so uncomfortable I sometimes get physically ill if I sit through the whole thing. I avoid episodes of my favorite TV shows if there's any perceived awkward or cringy moments, even short instances of them. I can't watch Star Wars or Back to the Future because the special effects are so bad they make me cringe. I'm a pretty sociable person for someone with GAD, but if anything awkward presents itself (even if it's not that awkward) I immediately isolate. And I think it's because I circulate the thoughts of it happening to me. 

I get those thoughts like, ""what if I accidentally glance over at the guy at the urinal next to me? What if he's into it? What if he's not? Will he punch me? Am I gay? I'm not gay, but what if this guy thinks I am? Now I can't pee. Will this dude notice I can't pee now? Will he say something to me about it?"". Or, here's a popular one, ""what if I just leaned in and kissed this person I'm talking to? I wouldn't do that! Wait, would I? What if I did? That would be terrible and probably assault. Could I end up in jail if I kissed this person?"" and they just get worse from there. 

So my question is, are those thought repetitions or unwanted thoughts, specifically about cringworthy or awkward material, typical of OCD or somewhat common within the community? Am I underestimating how much this affects my life? I feel like I need to talk about it in therapy more. Can any of you relate to this? Because it's getting to the point where I'll avoid things in life just in case they take that turn.",OCD,1576944899,CapRavOr,2,1,True,2019-12-21
What helps you the most when dealing with OCD?,"I‚Äôve always been a perfectionist, but it got to the point where when I was 16, I tried to kill myself for simply dropping a bowl of freshly made salad. Before then I would verbally and physically punish myself for every little mistake I made because I believed I deserved it. Every time I talk to my mom about needing a diagnostic or mental help she tells me that I can just fix this problem myself and it‚Äôs just my thoughts and somehow I can just magically change my thoughts. So I‚Äôve never been diagnosed, researched a lot of different disorders but the root of my problems seems to be this kind of OCD, perfectionism in which now I am so extremely restless about self-improvement that I get depressed and have panic attacks when I‚Äôm not doing something productive. I can‚Äôt relax unless I‚Äôm gaining something from it. I feel like I should be able to mentally help myself on my own too, but when something doesn‚Äôt immediately work right away I freak out or something. So what do you think would help me the most? Or what has helped all of you dealing with OCD.",OCD,1576945492,alpacapotato,6,1,True,2019-12-21
I wish that my SO was more understanding..,"SO was a groomsman in his friend from his childhood home‚Äôs wedding, and being his +1 meant meeting people I didn‚Äôt know. 

As we check into the hotel, one of his friend‚Äôs girlfriend comes running up to him and hugs him. (Not acknowledging me at all) He noticed her ignoring me to so he tries to introduce me to her and I smile and say hello and she just says ‚Äúoh hi‚Äù and immediately RUNS AWAY. Literally runs. And it wasn‚Äôt just my OCD saying she was super rude and awkward, everyone else thought so too. 

So of course OCD sends me into full blown ‚Äúeveryone hates me, why am I even here? I‚Äôm better off alone, I‚Äôm bringing SO down and ruining his life‚Äù panic mode. I tell him to go to the wedding and I will just stay in the hotel room because I don‚Äôt want to go where I‚Äôm not welcome. 

So what does he do? He starts a fight with me. Says he won‚Äôt choose between me and his friends. Says I ruined the trip by freaking out and I ruin every trip we go on because of my attitude and being too sensitive. I wish my OCD wouldn‚Äôt make me panic and have perpetually hurt feelings. I wish I could brush things off. But he just makes me feel like a huge asshole for something I can‚Äôt control. 

I ended up coming with him to the wedding once the panic subsided a bit but I still keep replaying in my head how the friend acted to me and I flip flop between being furious and being extremely sad that everyone hates me even when they don‚Äôt know me.

Now my OCD is ruminating trying to find ANYTHING that will help me figure out if I indeed do but it feels like I just am grasping at straws, I won‚Äôt know what is a false memory and what isn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt remember anything too particularly weird but now I get this sensation as if my OCD is combing every single memory it can remember for any sort of trigger to trigger a repressed memory and I‚Äôm just having a panic attack.

If I do, it's definitelty a very mild form and I know there's enough people these days claiming they have OCD so I definitely don't wanna be one of those guys. However I have thought a lot about it recently and I do relate to some OCD-things. First of all, it was definitely worse when I was younger. I would have compulsions like having to walk up and down the stairs x amount of times or before going to bed I had to turn on and off the lights x amounts of times or else I couldnt stop thinking about it. I know I had others aswell but I cant quite remember them. I remember always trying to surpress these thoughts and as I got older I got better at it and at this point I no longer have these compulsions. However in recent years I have gotten maybe a little germophobic? I dont know if its bad enough to be called germophobic but I definitely have some mild symptoms of it. I am very concious of what I'm touching and will do my best to avoid touching anything dirty. If I do touch something I think is dirty I will keep it in the back of my mind the exact spot that was ""contaminated"" and will do my best not to touch anything to contaminate further and wash my hands at the first oppertunity. It's not super bad though and while I try to avoid it, shaking peoples hands is not something that causes too much discomfort. Basically I just seem to have some mild symptoms of OCD/germophobia but I'm very unsure if this is enough to qualify as having OCD or not.

I think mine is rational.

I do not want the urge to urinate, because it hurts, and if I piss my pants, people can react negatively to that. I've determined that drinking little water makes me urinate less, and drinking a lot of water makes me urinate more. Therefore, I do not want to leave home if I've drunk water in a bad way.

I guess the only irrational part is that I can't urinate in front of others, or under social pressure.

False attraction (is that possible?),"I apologize for posting something here when I told myself I wouldn't but I need opinions on this!

I... Was watching TV and I have been very careful to watch certain shows or movies that don't show children... Because I immediately get panic and wonder if I'm attracted to them (specially girls) and have intrusive thoughts! And begin to question if I truly have ocd!!

Before you ask, yes I am in therapy and I was diagnosed with severe ocd but is it possible to experience false attraction? I hate these thoughts and this feelings! When I didn't have OCD, I wouldn't question if I was a ""p"" or not! But after a story with a friend's sister, everything changed and I began to wonder if I was a p or not!

I even gave her piggyback rides on the pool because I was trying to dismiss those thoughts... But now I just feel gross and a predator... I've always wanted to have a sister and she was very sweet child but I remember feeling dirty while trying to overcome those thoughts... I felt bad that day... And today, remembering that episode, I just feel deviant for doing so... I know I didn't do it to have some type weird experience (I don't know what ""p"" get from exposure to children) but I don't know... I feel gross and sad... And now I wonder if I wanted something else, something improper...

I wonder if I had some sort of romantic attraction to her, that's why I wanted to play with her on the pool and ""touch her"" like when someone has a crush on another person. I just feel so bad thinking about it! I don't think I had that intention but what if it was all a secret desire I don't know about? Next time, I was there I completely avoided the child...

I searched around on the internet to see if it would seriously hurt me or cause long-term damage, and I'm getting really anxious because I can't find anything that gives me a concrete answer.

I didn't notice anything wrong with the food, as far as I could certainly tell, and my brother had eaten some the night before. I haven't felt very sick. I did experience some kind of indigestion or acid reflux, but I think that may unrelated? I tried to vomit out of fear that I may have wrecked my health, but it didn't work, so now I'm trying to figure out whether or not I should really be concerned, but again, trying to find straight answers when there are a whole lot of things that cause food poisoning and a lot of different kinds is not proving to be an easy task.

Any knowledge on this would be appreciated. I don't think I'll experience any life-long side effects if I don't get actual food poisoning in the first place, but I don't know.",OCD,1576968196,sadnoodleboi,2,1,True,2019-12-21

He‚Äôs been so supportive, and really helping me out. Except yesterday, I knew that if I confessed something, it would hurt his feelings. But I did, and it ruined a beautiful day we were having. I really, really hurt him.

Pedophilia or POCD?,"Hello. I've made multiple posts but, Thing is I'm afraid I'm a pedophile. This has been going on for months now, and I've made posts about it but, I've got this thought that I cannot get over and talking about it helps I guess...  


I had a thought recently where I put myself in a scenario where my Moms' friend (which is a Mom) asked me to have sex with her daughter and the daughter standing in the doorway naked (I know this is a weird thought). Her daughter is either my sister's age which is 11 or younger than my sister and I'm 15 almost 16. Now, obviously I know this would never happen but, I'm afraid I would say ""yes"" instead of no... Idk... This thought also aroused me and I'm very scared... I just don't know... I tried imagining another completely different, non-existent child being in that situation and I think I thought ""no, I wouldn't"" but I'm afraid It may be this specific child and that It's because I'm attracted to her because I don't know what I would say in that situation... ugh I just, idk...

What do I say to people with HOCD as an LGBT person.,"So, I'm a bisexual trans woman,

I've gotten in a few (like 6 in total, a few on reddit PMS a few on mental health chatrooms) conversations with people who have OCD about being gay or trans, and in each of them I've more or less been asked ""what's it like"" and ""how/when did you know""

Basically asking about my experiences to see if theirs match.

And, given that I have OCD myself. I guess I'd be a decent person to ask.

I think I've handled it okay, I think I'm generally good a comforting people, but, now I'm thinking, I mean, should I even be answering questions about ""what its like"" to begin with?

I'm worried I'll say something that unintentionally validates their obsession.

I feel like they might latch onto similarities and get fucked over.

Buuuut, at the same time, I mean, (and I honestly don't even want to say this here), I'm worried that someone might actually be trans and is using OCD as a way to deny it. 

Because a lot of LGBT people (Especially trans people) have the opposite obsession, constantly second guessing even when its blatantly obvious. 

Its just, goddamnit, I feel anxious even pointing that out.

I've been asked to explain Gender Dysphoria, I did, and they said after that it brought some peace of mind that they probably weren't because they hadn't really experienced it, but I realized just now, wait, isn't that also validating? 

I don't like the idea of just refusing to answer their question, and I also never know what to respond with if I'm asked stuff like ""Should I try crossdressing"" or ""should I try shaving my body"", etc. both helped me realize I was trans, but I cant tell if that's a horrible or good idea for them.

Idk if I'll have a convo about this again, but I'm not sure what to say if I do.",OCD,1576977684,IrisTheTranny,5,1,True,2019-12-21
"POCD is slowly killing me (Vent, put TW just in case)","I hate living with this. I hate it. I'd never wish this hell on my worst enemy.

I used to be able to interact with children with no problem. But now? I can't even be near one without spiralling into panic mode. I avoid them at all costs; I can't even bear the mere IDEA of being around children, not even my own nieces, nephews, and cousins. It's sad because one of my nieces is always asking about me, and always asking where I am. I wish I could be a good aunt/cousin, and I want to be a good aunt/cousin. I want to be a good role model for them. But that's not happening now, and it's all because of my OCD.

I keep my hands firmly to myself when I have to be near a child because the thoughts crop up despite any and all attempts to stop them: ""What if you inappropriately touch that kid?"" Just a series of ""what if""s that makes my stomach churn. And interacting with kids at work, whether they're coming back up to the counter for refills or to trade a toy for an ice cream cone? ""What if you look at that kid for too long and their parents think you're a pedo?"" And I either try to make the interaction as brief as possible or get someone else to take care of them because the thoughts just appear over and over and then I have to check if I'm aroused or if I'm looking at them the ""wrong"" way and it just leads to even more stress for me at work.

And god forbid I say that a kid is adorable, because ""what if that means you're secretly attracted to them?""

I can't even look at a picture of a friend's kid(s) because the thoughts happen even then. I have no control over them. These thoughts have driven me to tears because I automatically think I'm a horrible person who should be killed or locked up for the rest of my life. I've been driven to suicidal ideation over them, because clearly I'm scum and the world would be much better without me. I can't get rid of these thoughts. I can't get rid of them and I want them gone for good, but I can't.

I may have an idea of why I have these thoughts. It may stem from trauma I experienced as a kid (CSA/COCSA). And I curse everyone that did all that stuff to me. I never want a kid to go through what I went through. I especially don't EVER want to put a kid through all the shit that happened to me. I wanted to be a good parent for any kids I may have in the future. I wanted to give a kid unconditional love and support, and to just be the perfect parent. But that dream is shattered now.

I don't know how much more I can take of this. I'm slowly being driven to madness by this POCD and I hate it. I just want to live a happy and normal life. I can't go on like this. I can't.",OCD,1576978361,stardust_dreaming,1,1,True,2019-12-21

TRYING TO OVERCOME MY POCD.,"This has been going for a few weeks now, while these intrusive thoughts would have me believe otherwise I know in my heart and in my soul I'm not a pedophile. I could never do these things to a kid. Everytime I get these vivid intrusive thoughts I feel no sexual arousal despite my groinal response. While I believe my OCD is the result of years of chronic masturbation and porn addiction ( regular porn, never watched child porn and never will) since then I have gone 4 days so far with out watching porn although the fapping is a bit harder to give up , now I am and always have been sexually attracted to women my age or older and as a matter of fact in response to my  groinal sensation earlier while I do feel a tingling feeling in my groin due 2 these thoughts I never get an erection, on the other hand when I ever I think women my age or older in a sexual manner I have no problem getting it up aleast until  I have an intrusive thought about teens/kids and my wood go right back down ( lately I have been able to push those thoughts aside more easily as I fap). Before last November I never had these thoughts ever. The posts I have seen have explained how years of porn addiction can warp your mind this way and honestly now I wish I'd never seen porn at all. I have also read posts from people who suffered this for years but where able to OVERCOME it eventually as I am trying to now. Recently I have told my mom what my problem is and she had agreed to get me psychiatric help (POCD specific) and support groups, there are no words to describe how grateful I am 4 her sticking by me , I truly feel like im not in this alone now. I have been trying the ERP approach and I do see alot of kids at my job. Now they say the key is mindfulness and opening your self to the root of these thoughts,  not rejecting or accepting just ignoring them completely until they fade away.  Basically getting used these thoughts in your head which is kinda like accepting them and that's where I fail. Evertime I try I only feel shame ,disgust, and anger and I reject.

Wondering if any of you do this? (copying the letter a) (copying the letter a anxiety) (copying the letter a ocd),"Background: I've never been diagnosed with OCD. Been talking with my psychiatrist and other people about how I feel and what I do and what not. And my psychiatrist mentioned OCD. That's the reason I've been looking around this subreddit seeing if anyone does anything like me. But, this is a weird one and completely random.

I've tried searching around to see if anyone else does this. I think it's a worry of my copy paste history being sent incorrectly which it is but, I also really don't care because I'm smart enough not to mess up and do this. But, everytime I copy and paste something or writing anything or in the middle of writing something. I do this.

type ""a"" ctrl + shift OR shift + left arrow key IF I KNOW I WONT COPY ANYTHING ELSE THEN ctrl + c. 

I tried explaining it the best possible right their. And I always need to copy the letter ""a"" always or usually lowercased. This is to prevent any accidents or accidental copy pastes or whatever.. Now I do normally copy paste stuff and use the function a lot (A LOT). But, why? I know I've been diagnosed with general anxiety disorder (not sure if the disorder is supposed to be their but, it was general anxiety whatever. also a few others things I've been diagnosed with unrelated here.)

But, why do I do this? And does ANYONE do this here. Please tell me someone here does this. PLEASE. I want to know it's just me even though it probably 100% is.

side note: wrote things in the title in curved brackets or whatever they're called (can't remember right now) to get any people searching the chance to find this thread to know and understand if they're not the only one.

As a kid I would stay awake at night for *hours* and watch my door so I could see if an intruder was going to come into my room. I would regularly wake up my parents to tell them I thought someone was in the house. I even slept on the floor of their room for a while because I was so scared and they didn‚Äôt think it was a problem; I was like 12 or 13. I‚Äôm 20 and I still sleep with the lights on and keep my eyes open staring at the wall or ceiling for maybe 2-3 hours. I also still check under my bed and in my closet. Also behind shower curtains whenever I use the bathroom. My house has never been broken into so I‚Äôm not sure what causes this paranoia?

contamination thoughts/fears are getting worse,"my whole time living with OCD contamination has never really been a fear of mine however recently I can't stop thinking about it.

I find myself thinking about all of the dirt and grime on things I touch and how it's now on my skin and I try my hardest to avoid touching my eyes/mouth etc in fear of contracting something or getting sick. that's when I'd go wash my hands a good few times in order to avoid that. but I know that with OCD these things can spiral very quickly so I'm pretty scared. I can't say an exact point in time I started to get these thoughts about contamination but I do know that it's becoming more often. 

I wouldn't say its that severe at the moment but  I'm just scared that it'll get worse, and I wanna know if there's anyway I can try to curb it as it is. I'm planning to bring it up to my therapist during my next appointment but that isn't for another month ish.

Obsession with meditation / therapy?,"Hi, 

I just wanted to create this post to see if anybody else can relate to this. I was diagnosed with OCD as a teenager. I gradually recovered with medication but was left with ongoing anxiety issues. I'm in my late twenties now. I was taught mindfulness in a few years ago and this seemed to help me greatly. I was more social, calmer and happier. 

However this slowly changed and the past year has been hell. I seem to have developed this weird obsession with meditation itself. All I think about is if meditation is the 'right' thing to do or not. I've spent weeks checking to see if my body or movement feels 'right' or not before/ during/ after meditation. I've tried to just not do it but my mind gets really agitated and uneasy after a few days. It's like I'm afraid life will always be awful if I don't do it.

DAE have ASD and OCD. How do you tell them apart?,"37 m and received diagnosis of ASD and OCD about half a month ago.  Still trying to come to terms with it. I was diagnosed with ADHD as a child but it turns out that it was an 80% chance that it was a wrong diagnosis according to the Psychologist who evaluated me. The OCD came as a shock. I don't feel that I have obsessive thoughts but I think the truth is that I just never noticed them because I never knew to look for them. Now that I do, I can see how it fits but can't always recognize the thoughts. Evidently, my need for perfection is just OCD. Between OCD and ASD, I'm not sure what parts of my behavior and thoughts are my personality and what belongs to the conditions. I can't talk to family about it because my Mom would only use it against me and my siblings don't get it or deny it. I have no friends to talk to about it either. I'm not sure how to move forward with this information because I don't know what it means. I'm stuck in knowing what parts of my behavior are the conditions and which parts are me. At least I am scheduled for therapy and he said he will help with OCD, feeling recognition and social skills. I wonder if that is enough to make me ready to live  independently?  I wonder if that will be enough to know how to keep my job and not get fired or quit it. I look back at my life and I'm just sad how it turned out. My brother has a PHD in statistics and an amazing career and family. My sister has a Masters in statistics and an amazing family.   It is hard not to compare myself to them.

My first dose on citalopram,"I took citalopram in the morning today and I was really scared but I was very desperate to feel a bit of relief cause I have been so exhausted worrying about my health every single day and worrying that I might just die everytime there's a trigger. An hour after I took it I noticed my jaw clenching. I try to relax but its like my jaw's default mode is just to clench. Its not that bad, it doesnt bother me too much. I've also been yawning nonstop. I feel very tired that no amount of body stretches give me relief from feeling tired. 

I already feel a bit of relief from my anxiety. I didnt expect it to work on the first day but seeing the things that usually trigger me didnt bother me that much. It feels like I'm too exhausted to even think of it enough to worry me. Its really weird cause usually it would send me into a cycle when i see a red spot on my body for example, and then I look for other ones and then i become so hyperaware of everything then i start feeling a lot of pain and then think I'm dying. Its a huge relief already from day one from the constant worries about my health and death. 


I'm not sure how its gonna affect me with doing work yet cause I've tried to do some coursework today, but I found that i just couldnt concentrate. I wonder if the SSRI settles down a bit after a few weeks that I might be able to manage my perfectionism worh writing..I'm also diagnosed with adhd so I wonder if I would need to have stimulants with it as well but I really hope It will all be great cause this is such a huge step for me cause I've always been scared of taking long term medications.

Do I have OCD? Are there ways for me to get help without therapy?,"Before anyone asks, I know that the only way I can truly know if I have Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is if I talk to a doctor or psychiatrist. Unfortunately, due to my current circumstances, I‚Äôm unable to do so (I‚Äôd rather skip the details). I‚Äôm just asking you on your personal opinion about my situation, and if it seems to be stemming from OCD or not. Also, this is a throwaway.

TL;DR at the end.
(TW: Death)

When I was 12, I had a sudden onset of anxiety, where I suddenly thought that I and everyone I love were going to die a horrible death, unless I prayed at least 3 times a day that God could protect me and my loved ones from *insert at least 5 diseases or catastrophes here*. This lasted for about 3 months, until it suddenly became a lot less prominent. Sure, I had a ritual of holding my breath every time I was on a plane so that the plane didn‚Äôt crash, but at least these obsessions didn‚Äôt consume my entire time and being.

However, 6 years later, the exact same symptoms I had back then are resurfacing now. This time, I have to hold my breath every time I get into a car or vehicle or else I‚Äôm going to die in a car wreck. On top of that, I have to hold my breath every time one of my loved ones leave for a drive or else THEY will die in a car wreck too. The idea of death absolutely terrifies me because there‚Äôs nothing I can do to prevent my death or my loved one‚Äôs deaths. I think my behaviour also comes from my (irrational) mantra of ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt think something bad won‚Äôt happen IT WILL HAPPEN, and if you think something bad will happen it won‚Äôt happen.‚Äù

I‚Äôm now doubting the diagnosis of general anxiety that I was given. I think it‚Äôs very possible that this is rather a form of OCD, although I can‚Äôt be 100% sure. Does my description sound like I could be suffering from OCD? If so, do you have any suggestions on how to alleviate my symptoms (without therapy, since I simply can‚Äôt afford it)?

TL;DR: 12 year old me developed ‚Äúanxiety‚Äù for 3 months which made me pray to god 3 times a day for him to protect my family or else they and I would die horrible deaths. The ‚Äúanxiety‚Äù suddenly becomes much milder until now, where present day me now has the ritual to hold my breath every time I get into a car and every time I see a family member drive away or else they will die in a car wreck.

From the day the insults started, I would ignore him.

No More Setbacks!,"I have finally graduated to only seeing my psychiatrist every other month instead of every other week. After trying 10 different medications and being misdiagnosed by two different doctors, I am finally making good progress.

Today marks the first grocery shopping when I didn't have to buy a liter of bleach! I still clean everything several times but I have finally managed to stop using straight bleach to clean.

I just wanted to share because some of the medications made me a lot worse. They were giving me depression when I normally did not feel depressed. So if anyone is feeling worse on medications, please tell your doctor or psychiatrist. And if your doctor doesn't listen like my first doctor, find one who will. When I switched doctors, he had to sort through everything my first doctor did and then had to take me off of medications that were not helping. But once he got everything sorted out, I started actually getting better.

I no longer have to take benzos every day for panic attacks. I'm no longer terrified to step foot outside my door without my husband. I halved the time it takes for my compulsions and was able to complete 2 chores in a day instead of 1/2 a chore.

I know that the battle against OCD is hard and long, but when you start winning, it feels amazing. So anyone who is feeling like I did a few months ago, I am believing and praying that you hit the turning point and start winning soon.",OCD,1577066291,aproberts,1,1,True,2019-12-22

Is it possible to experience only certian symptoms of OCD without having it full on? (HEAVY),"Hello!
I posted here for the first time a while back, said post being about my mom with OCD. 

I know dor sure that I've inhereted some of her less flattering traits. We both experience guilt in a very certian way, for example. While a more common person may hear somebody say ""hey, you did this thing that upset me,"" and react with a sting of guilt and an apology, me and mom are different. We both become completely unable to function properly and will go into what looks like a minor depression for several days, unable to go to work or school. We're bombarded with thoughts like ""I'm a terrible, horrible person"" ""Oh god, what if i hurt my friend so bad that their life is ruined?"" and simlar. My ""cure"" for this type of guilt has usually been to talk trough the situation with my dad. He's calm and level headed. The guilt will dissaper after a few days, usually.

(Here comes the potentially heavy part, please don't read on if mentions of suicide is upsetting to you.)

A few years back, I started having horribly disruptive intrusive thoughts. I'm not going to go into what they were, but they were very uncomfortable and sent me into a... depression, I supppse, where I several times considered killing myself to make these thoughts go away. Sounds just like intrusive thoughts simlar to OCD, right? Well... here's the ""thing."" I left them untreated for several years, and they just kind of... dissapered on their own. They still apper every once in a while, but most often dissaper again after a few hours. They are not a part of my life any longer. I am no longer suicidal or depressed in any way.

Random paranoid thoughts and OCD?,"IÔ∏è have had a very rough two weeks. Due to some stress from work/a new job, the holidays, and eating poorly IÔ∏è had an IBS flair up about two weeks ago. IÔ∏è also have anxiety/panic disorder and OCD. IÔ∏è hadn‚Äôt had a panic attack in almost a year until last week. Since then I‚Äôve woken up from my sleep 5 times with one. I‚Äôve been incredibly stressed, suffering from IBS/GI issues, and I‚Äôve been very anxious and antsy. A few days ago IÔ∏è added paranoia into that mix. I‚Äôve struggled with intrusive thoughts forever and it feels like one but i‚Äôm unsure. When IÔ∏è was in high school my mom confided in me that she wanted to divorce my stepdad. So he was constantly angry around the house and clearly depressed. IÔ∏è began this strange fear that he was going to poison me/try to kill me. That went away eventually (this was in 2012.) They never divorced and have moved on happily. Recently due to the holiday stress he‚Äôs been acting angry and sad again. Well this weird fear from 2012 has triggered again. IÔ∏è got him a new knife set for Christmas (because he‚Äôs a cook and wanted one) and now IÔ∏è get these thoughts that IÔ∏è should be scared he‚Äôs going to hurt me with them. Then this morning my iPhone was acting very strange. My messages wouldn‚Äôt open and IÔ∏è had to reset my phone.

I think I may have OCD... Can anyone offer advice?,"Throwaway account. Trigger warning. Don't read on if sexual abuse is a tough topic for you. For those who read the whole thing- thank you. This is my first time discussing my abuse on the internet, and i'm nervous.

Hi. I am a 23 y/o female who has suffered from sexual abuse at the age of 7. A friend of the family removed my clothing, drugged my mom and did the same to her, and exposed himself to me. Forced me to touch him, chased me around the house, touched my rear end. Told me that it was my fault and that I would be in big trouble if I told on him, which I did two weeks later. He ended up going to jail for a bit, and got bailed out. The justice system is horse shit.

Anyway, I hated therapy as a kid and convinced my parents I didn't need it after the first year. I didn't want to talk about it, I just wanted to be a normal kid and have fun. I wanted to forget.

This has never greatly affected me until the last year. I'm having intrusive thoughts, where I don't want to look at children because it hurts. I'm afraid to have kids in the future because I don't want them to think I don't love them if i'm not kissing their forehead and stuff, it just seems weird to me. I know it isn't normal, but I'm a natural worry wart anyway and I can't help but think about these things.

Additionally, growing up (ages 12-17ish) I felt like my brain was fucking with me. I would be driving and all of the sudden think ""if you don't switch lanes right now, it's bad luck."" And I would do it. Or I would think ""If you don't walk back and forth 3 times, it won't feel right."" And I would do it. I knew it wasn't normal, but I didn't think it was ABNORMAL either. Eventually, I forced myself to stop doing this and would just refuse to do the action when it popped into my head. 

Now that I'm in my 20's, I experience thoughts about how I am a bad person because of the whole kid thing. I want to clarify (after reading some OCD information online) that I do not have sexual thoughts or obsessive sexual thoughts about anyone or anything besides my partner, although I may be reminded of my abuse when seeing kids or certain adults in my life, which then makes me feel like a bad person. I feel like I am driving myself crazy sometimes, and I try my best to suppress it all, but now I am questioning whether or not I need to see someone, or if I am just letting stuff get to me that I shouldn't. I would like to add that although little thoughts pop in and out sporadically throughout my days, I don't really fester on things or spend hours worrying unless I am under the influence of marijuana, or right before bed. I'm about to just quit weed altogether because it is exaggerating this entire ordeal.

Anyway- thank you for any help or advice you may offer me, because I am struggling with shame, guilt, and worry that if I tell a family member or my partner they will not understand.",OCD,1577123215,ziggityzag1234,1,1,True,2019-12-23

I can't eat any of my family's food for the holidays.,"My OCD mainly revolves around me not eating certain ""types"" of food. These ""types"" include: anything that someone has touched, anything that I've looked away from and don't know where it's been, and anything that has been made using pans and utensils that I know where they've been. This really only leaves me to eat wrapped food or making my own food using a pan that NO ONE else has used (This gets difficult because even if I tell people not to use something, they still do). 

This has developed over 2 years, and honestly I just want it to be gone. I can understand why my OCD doesn't like the food at home and thinks it has germs and such, but I don't understand why it won't let me eat any other food that it knows has been clean? It makes eating hard and getting enough food every day harder. So, to compensate with little food I instead eat chocolate... something that really isn't good for my health but it helps me to at least have some energy everyday. I'm really tired of not eating proper food and getting enough nutrients or vitamins to sustain me.

 Additionally, this also makes the holidays really hard. Most times I just have to sit out and watch my family eat food while I don't. Sometimes they ask me about it and sometimes taunt me about it... but I can't really help that I have this type of OCD and I really want it to be gone.

"Contamination OCD, shower specific","First, please don't suggest therapy. I'm aware that I need therapy and am fully interested in getting treatment, I'm in several wait lists for therapists in my area. But for the time being, I don't know what to do. 

I'm at the end of my rope. I can't shower. Every shower I've taken in the last year has ended in a massive panic attack and having to lay down in the dark the rest of the day. I haven't always had issues with the shower, I used to love it and would stay in until there was no hot water. Now, they disgust me. It started a few years ago. I hate the feeling of the tub under my feet and the water on my skin, I'm terrified of touching the shower wall and curtain, I imagine (I KNOW it's not realistic but I can't stop myself from thinking it in the moment) that everything in the shower is covered by a layer of grime and germs. If the tub fills up even a little I feel like I might as well be wading through sewage. If the water isn't hot enough to burn my skin then I feel like it's not cleaning me. I can't touch anything in the shower without feeling like there are bugs crawling all over me, I feel more disgusting when I get out of the shower than when I get in. I'm at the point where I force myself to get in maybe once a week and wash the essentials and it always ends in me dry heaving and hyperventilating. It doesn't even end when I get out of the shower, the bathroom floor makes my skin crawl and the towels have all probably been touched by someone else so they're dirty and I have to walk past the toilet and it's such a tiny space that probably everything has particles from the toilet on it (I know it's just me putting the lid down before I flush). All of this is made worse by the fact that it's a shared bathroom. It's separated from my bedroom by a wall. I just heard my father in law shower, turn off the water, spit in the tub, and then pull the curtain back and get out and my mind is racing and I can't stop thinking about how I have to shower today (it's been several days) and it's making my skin crawl. I'm going to think about that every time I try to shower now. 

I know that I need therapy and I am looking into it, wait times in my area are months, but if anyone has any suggestions for how to make this easier for the time being I would be so thankful.. Playing music sometimes helps, and I have a separate bath mat that no one else uses, my husband also helps me bleach the tub before my showers but it helps very little. My issues with contamination manifest in other areas of my life as well, but the shower/bathroom is the main thing and definitely the most crippling. I also have an issue with toilet spray back, especially in public bathrooms, I feel like I'm filthy and with every flush from every toilet I'm being sprayed with particles and they're visible and they're going to make me sick. If anyone has any suggestions for coping with this while I wait for an available therapy appointment, I'd be really grateful.

Don't do it,"You, yes you!

An OCD thought is probably screwing with you right now.

Say fuck it and don't pay attention to it.  Let's face it even if you give in to the thought/compulsion and it gives you brief satisfaction it will come back in a different form and this time even worse. This will keep happening as long as you are giving in to ""it"".

You have the weird heavy feeling in your body, you are about to have a panic attack or already have it. Fine it will be like this for a time forward but it will get better, just don't give in to ""it"".  

It is your choice:

1. You are feeling crap ----&gt; giving in to the thought/compulsion/seeking reasurrance  -----&gt;  satisfied for some time ----&gt; new thought pops up ------&gt; You are feeling crap
2. You are feeling crap ----&gt;  Don't fucking give in to ""it"" -----&gt; it will be hard, but it will get better ------&gt; after some time you will spend much less time on ""it"" ------&gt; you will look back on this moment and see how useless this thought was and probably laugh at yourself. -------&gt; You are now managing your ocd much better, maybe you are even free from it.

So it is up to you choose 1 or 2. 

1 will haunt you and make you feel like shit your entire life.

2 will make you feel like shit in another way but will make you much better at handling/""spending much less time"" on your OCD and maybe will set you free from your OCD forever.

&amp;#x200B;

""it"" = ocd/thought/etc...

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

There is a pretty good technique to make this easier. When you get ""it"" say that you will ""do"" it later(we both know you will not do this) this will make it easier but you will eventually forget about the specific thought.

The friend spends a long time arguing about how ridiculous the fears are, and gets mad, and thinks his friend is boring and weird.

My big problem with the OCD that causes me to be stuck in life,"It's my first time here and I wanted to tell you about one of the most serious problems I'm having with the ocd that I haven't been able to solve so far.

About 3 years ago at the end of my time as a student I began to develop certain rituals to relieve anxiety, I did not know exactly why but I associated it with a period of much stress so I did not give it importance at that time, the problem was when this period ended and these rituals as time became more and more annoying and even a moment that came to destroy my quality of life and feeling that I was in a loop that was not able to leave.

After some time researching on my own I was able to put a name to what was happening to me and see myself reflected in many other people's behaviors, these last 2 years with a lot of effort I was gradually removing these types of rituals from the simplest one like washing my hands every time I started a new task, from the obsession with always having the music at the same volume or stopping the music just at the second that corresponds to a number that I find pleasant and countless rituals that made my life very complicated and made me lose a lot of time that I could be investing in doing something better.

The ritual that I am unable to remove is something complex and it is something that I have to remove from my life as soon as possible because it is hurting me a lot in my life and it prevents me from progressing, the ritual consists of several parts an obsession with numbers along with an obsession with bad news that induces very negative thoughts in me.

The habit begins when I want to start incorporating good habits into my life such as eating well, quitting pornography and more, so I decide that tomorrow I will start incorporating them but tomorrow is day 14 for example, then I decide that that day I will not start because that number I do not like that I was left as the day I started to change my life, many times that thought towards that number usually comes from bad news that has happened that day then I link that number with the bad news, that's why I try to avoid watching the news because if I don't want to link the bad news that comes out with the number of the day in which it is. If a bad news happens in that week I can't start either because I link the day I wanted to change my life with the week or month that the bad news happened.
This is so bad that it doesn't allow me to improve anything because I'm always on a loop looking for the perfect day even the perfect week or month that nothing bad happens to start new habits.

I am not able to solve it, I tried to convince myself that they are thoughts that lack of logic but this form does not help me to solve it and rarely helped me in other rituals, I do not know if exactly it is the fear that its going to happen bad things for having started that day something bad happened, in addition to this ritual compared to other rituals the moment of anxiety lasts a short time but this being a day that will always be there for the day that start changing my life that anxiety lasted me all the time and not go out until I start again with my bad habits.

After OCD I feel like I don't even know what attraction is anymore,"I've recently been diagnosed with HOCD and am seeing a therapist. I've posted here before, but I'm not seeking reassurance, just advice. 


I recently broke up with my bf of 2 years whom I was really attracted to. Our sex life wasn't great, which had nothing to do with my OCD, but I genuinely enjoyed being sexual with him. When I reflect on our time together, I feel as certain as I can be with OCD that I was truly attracted to him--I never doubted it at the time (I didn't really struggle with HOCD then), and even now that we're separated the attraction I felt to him is one of the few certainties that comforts me through this HOCD nightmare. 


Now that I'm dating again, I feel as though I have no idea how to recognize feelings of attraction, which is causing me to avoid all kinds of social situations. I was never strongly attracted to appearance anyway and much preferred guys that I connected with or that were kind or made me laugh, which is leading me to consider that I might be demisexual. However, that possibility coupled with my HOCD is sending me in circles. Since looks don't matter as much to me, my OCD is latching onto that and distorting it, telling me that I have feelings for every girl I like being around, even my friends. I'm losing touch with my reality to the point that I feel defeated--unlike my harm ocd where I can remind myself that my magical thinking is illogical, it's becoming harder and harder to see the ""lie"" in this OCD. 


I know I loved my boyfriend and was attracted to him, but since my HOCD has flared up, I feel like I can't gauge my own attraction to anyone else and it's really scaring me. I don't want this to bring my life to a halt, but connecting with people and attempting to date is just leading to constant internal battles with my mind, and I'm really desperate for some insight/advice.",OCD,1577133568,incompetent9871,3,1,True,2019-12-23

End of year ruminations...does life with OCD ever get better? Or is this just it?,"I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm more reflective about it because of the time of year...but seriously, does it ever get better?

This year my entire life fell apart due to my OCD. I had a bad reaction to the meds which made me have a seizure. Total one off, but I convinced myself it was something untoward in spite of all the tests. Like seriously I‚Äôve had so many medical tests I can‚Äôt believe my OCD can still make up health obsessions! 

After the seizure, I was too scared to do anything. I cancelled my gym membership, cut off all my friends, and isolated myself. I started working all the hours in the world so that I could have an excuse for why I wasn‚Äôt seeing friends or going out and doing things.  All my hopes and dreams went down the toilet and my life is just filled with such inertia because I‚Äôm too scared. This in turn gives me more time to spend with my OCD, which in turn makes me freak out more. 

My intrusive thoughts now especially consist of epilepsy symptoms so every now and then I‚Äôll think ‚Äòwas that familiar did I just have Deja vu‚Äô and now I can‚Äôt even read or watch tv much because I constantly sit and obsess over every page/scene and whether or not it was Deja vu to the point where I can‚Äôt tell the difference between Deja vu and not Deja vu. It‚Äôs so bad that my psychiatrist knows it isn‚Äôt epilepsy but I still have to see a neurologist so they can definitely tell him/me that I can go back on my meds. 

I also sit and think of every bad little thing I‚Äôve ever done (and I‚Äôve never actually done anything that bad, I‚Äôm talking like thinking about when I was five or something and said something mean to another kid at school). I convince myself I am a horrible person and don‚Äôt deserve anything good or to be happy. 

At the minute until I get the all clear from the neurologist I am not allowed to take my medication and honestly I dunno if I will take it after that because there‚Äôs dispute about whether I just fainted due to that ssri acquired long qt syndrome that goes away when you stop taking the meds so it wouldn‚Äôt have come up on tests. So in my head if it wasn‚Äôt even a seizure then what weight does the neurologist even carry? And I don‚Äôt have access to any talking therapies. 

So I‚Äôm literally at a loss. Does it ever get better? This horrible illness has decimated my life and I have no idea how to dig myself out of it. I can‚Äôt take the meds and I don‚Äôt have the possibility of talking therapy and my psychiatrist will discharge me if I don‚Äôt take the meds. Like I said I‚Äôve lost my friends and my family tell me I have nothing to be stressed over so I don‚Äôt know what to do and I‚Äôm afraid that I‚Äôm going to let my life get worse and worse.

Im mentally going through the thought to see if its logical. Sometimes i find a thing that makes the thought illogical and that makes the thought go away until a new one shortly appears and the loop is back again.

Well, to this day and from here to infinity and beyond, I have not and will not say that to him. Personally this is the most important triumph I've had against ocd.

Advice for helping my 4yo,"My 4yo son has not eaten since the 14th, it is now the 24th, he stopped drinking on the 17th which is the same day he was hospitalised. He has been on a glucose iv and is now on a nasogastric tube. 

While he has had avoidant and restrictive behaviour around food for a long time he has always been able to eat what I consider a fair range of foods. 

We live in a very rural area and the only child psychiatrist or psychologist that treats my area is only here once a month, which means that he doesn‚Äôt have a diagnosis yet. 

He has been prescribed a sedative and an anti anxiety which has helped him a lot. He will now tolerate talking about eating or drinking whereas before the meds he would scream and panic. 

When I ask him why he won‚Äôt eat or drink he tells me he doesn‚Äôt want anything in his tummy. Questioned further he says he doesn‚Äôt want the food to get germs in his mouth. He will sometimes say that he thinks that food will give him too much energy. 

I understand that I won‚Äôt really be able to rationalise any of this with him but I was hoping someone might have an idea that might help to calm him a little.

"A novel &amp; comic with a realistic representation of OCD: The Weight Of Our Sky by Hanna Alkaf (Reading this is potentially triggering, especially for Harm OCD)","Hello! I found a comic with a lead character who has OCD on a webcomic platform (Webtoon) that I use often, and figured this may be appreciated here.

I will however, warn that this book and comic are potentially triggering, especially for those with Harm OCD.

*** CONTENT WARNINGS: Racism, on-page death, graphic violence, OCD (Mostly Harm type OCD, with some counting/tapping compulsions) and anxiety triggers. If you are affected by any of these things, please do consider setting the book aside until you feel more able to take them on. ***

Here is the brief description:

A music loving teen with OCD does everything she can to find her way back to her mother during the historic race riots in 1969 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in this heart-pounding literary debut.

This book is indeed based on the true event of the deadly race riots that happened in 1969, in Malaysia's capital. For more information, if it interests you, I'd reccomend this article that is well done, even containing newpaper clippings, maps showing the location of the key events &amp; radio   recordings from the cops who were working at the time.

Problems with long term memory,"Hello,

I was just wondering if anyone else seems to have an issue with long term memory? I‚Äôve heard that can be a symptom of OCD, but naturally my mind blows it out of proportion.

Contamination OCD and relationships,"I recently had a small phone conversation with a mental health professional. He ask me when was my last romantic relationship. I felt ashamed and weird because I‚Äôm 24 and I never had a boyfriend. Like ever.

I think I am dealing with hit and run OCD,"I think I may be suffering from ocd. Specifically, in regards to my driving. I have only been driving for a little over a year, but I have begun obsessing over the past month or so. Every pothole or bump in the road really freaks me out. Today, I saw a pedestrian waiting to cross, and I turned, as she wasn't crossing, and had no visible intent to despite having the signal to do so, but I convinced myself I must have hit her and not felt or heard it. Of course, I *know* if I hit her, I would have felt or heard something. A car behind me would have stopped or something. Traffic continued moving like usual. Later this same day, I was leaving a parking lot, and struggled to turn out, and heard a weird noise. I was convinced I hit something and went back around. There was a lot of gravel spilled on the road, and my tires were struggling with it. That's all it was. Before this, I have had similar issues, but just with damaging other cars. I have convinced myself I am scraping or bumping cars nearly everywhere I go, and I am constantly checking my car for damage. It's an older used vehicle, and has scrapes all over, which makes matters even worse, because I never know if a mark is new or not. All of this has left me in a constant state of guilt and anxiety as of late. I guess I am mostly posting this to vent. I know it is all irrational, and after my brief research today, I do plan to do my best not to entertain my compulsions in the future. I do plan on seeking treatment if it goes on much longer, but this is a pretty recent development in my life.

How to react to my wife's OCD?,"My wife has OCD, I learned about it just after I met her. I'm not really sure what the best (healthiest) way to respond to her symptoms is. I'm also not sure what is just standard (or, acceptable level) cleanliness, and what is the OCD. I'll be describing some of her behaviors in here, so I'm not sure if that's going to trigger anyone.

Just in case, trigger warning:

I generally just follow her, and I've changed the way I do things to follow her rules. We wash our hands immediately after coming home, before touching anything. We wash our hands after touching certain things (money, garbage bin, keys etc.) if we're going to touch anything inside the house. (For example, if I touch my keys then touch the fridge door it's bad, but if I touch my keys then go out before touching anything in the house, all good.) We get changed into roomwear when we get home (can't sit down in clothes we've worn outside), and get changed into pajamas before we go to bed (can't wear roomwear in bed). 

All of these changes have been totally acceptable for me, and I have no problem doing them. They barely affect my life and seem to be (maybe somewhat excessive) good practice to keep a clean house + good hygiene. And, most of the time, they don't seem to bother her very much either. So it's hard to think of it as an OCD behavior, it feels more like excessive cleanliness. But I don't want to be enabling her, or making her problems worse.

Then there are the things she does herself: checking the locks, checking her alarms are set correctly, brushing her teeth, needing everything to be set perfectly before she can start work/sleep etc. these are things that are very obviously OCD behaviors, and very obviously harmful/frustrating to her. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do in these situations.

Generally, I just try to ignore it. Trying to stop her feels like the wrong thing to do, telling her to stop feels like telling a depressed person to be happy, but ignoring it doesn't feel right either. To be clear, her behavior only bothers me in that it makes her upset. If she was happy living with it, I'd be more than happy to ignore it, it doesn't bother me any. But sometimes it really gets to her, and I can't stand how it makes her feel

Is there any advice you can give me, about how to respond to her behavior in a way that will help?",OCD,1577165851,UisVuit,2,1,True,2019-12-24

I feel like im going crazy,"Long post
(Trigger warning: talks of self harm, eating disorders, suicide, and CSA(child sexual assulat)) 
So im going to start this with i have never been diagnosed with OCD. It was mentioned un therapy for like 2 seconds but never was really brought to the front lines. The reason im here is because my best friend who has OCD tells me hes like 99% sure i have it. He gives me advice best he can but I find myself still falling deeper into this oddly familiar loop off intrusive thoughts that make me spiral into a deep self destruction. 
For the past few years ive been on Sylexa. I was put on it for (what i was told) deppresion and anxiety. Before i was on it i struggled deeply with suicidal thoughts, self harm, social anxiety, and had a very bad eating disorder. The medicine really did help. I wanted to live again, i no longer found myself thinking every second of the day about food or the people around me. I still struggled. But it was better. 
As of today its probably been about a month since ive been on it. Maybe longer. Honestly time has been really distorted recently. This was not by choice. My Medicare suddenly gave out. We thought it would only be like a week to get it back but due to my recent name change its been having problems (im trans so thats what the name change is) but i no longer believe my mom. She has never liked me being in medicine. Especially the week or so before the insurance stopped. She said i had no energy and that she thought i had peaked on my meds. I disagreed with her. Now every time i ask her to see if my insurance is back she says shes been too busy with important things and hasnt even looked. I strongly believe shes just trying to avoid me getting back on meds as long as she can. 
So to overview how i feel. I feel like I'm going insane. My sucidal thoughts are back, my social anxiety is back, my intrusive thoughts about food are back. But it feels worse. My intrusive thoughts have found a new thing to obsess over. My sexual tramua. Since i was a kid my family has gropped me. It like is kind of traditon for my family? I dunno how to put it but every birth girl has experienced being touched is inappropriate ways. It was weird hearing it wasnt normal. At a recent family christmas party my uncle grabbed my ass and my entire family laughed while i stood there in shock. It had been awhile since someone had done that. That day marked when my spiral became horrible. I sat in the church nursery and listened to the same song all the rest of the day. I broke. I felt dead. What had happened opened up a lot of scars and reppressed memories. That night i broke my (i think 3 year) streak of being self harm free. 
The intrusive thoughts about this are basically my brain telling me 3 things. 1. I was into what happened to me and i have a incest/csa fetish. Which i KNOW is not true but its becoming hard to tell myself that. 2. Im being a complete baby and overreacting 3. It never actually happened. It almost like it physically hurts and my brain plays these thoughts on repeat. It keeps me up at night, keeps me from enjoying time with my friends, keeps my dreams from being peaceful. Last night i had a dream i was being trafficed for sex and i woke up feeling horrid. 
Today at work i started to pick and scratch all over myself. And as i was getting carts I debated for awhile if i should jump in front of a car. I wouldnt have to be in so much pain anymore. Plus my friends would no longer have to worry about me. But i didnt obviously but my brain is saying i should have. I have myself convinced im a horrid person even thought i know that if my friend went through the exact same thing i would never call them horrible. It seems like all i do with my friends rn is worry them. They deserve a friend they don't have to worry about. 
Another thing that i cant stop thinking about is that im faking these thoughts in order to be closer to my friend. My best friend is just like me. Like hell we even have similar tramua. The big difference for awhile was he had ocd. Then when i dropped medicine i startes ti get symptoms. Even if i had them before with food i keep saying how im a horrid person faking mental illness in order to get closer to him
I feel like im dieing. Every waking moment (even sleeping movement) these thoughts play. I don't want to feel like this anymore. I hate everything about myself. I dont feel i deserve fo be happy

Im not sure if this is like asking for advice. I think its more just ranting. I feel so alone in my mind. Like I'm trapped

My big problem with OCD that causes me to be stuck in life,"It's my first time here and I wanted to tell you about one of the most serious problems I'm having with the ocd that I haven't been able to solve so far.

About 3 years ago at the end of my time as a student I began to develop certain rituals to relieve anxiety, I did not know exactly why but I associated it with a period of much stress so I did not give it importance at that time, the problem was when this period ended and these rituals as time became more and more annoying and even a moment that came to destroy my quality of life and feeling that I was in a loop that was not able to leave.

After some time researching on my own I was able to put a name to what was happening to me and see myself reflected in many other people's behaviors, these last 2 years with a lot of effort I was gradually removing these types of rituals from the simplest one like washing my hands every time I started a new task, from the obsession with always having the music at the same volume or stopping the music just at the second that corresponds to a number that I find pleasant and countless rituals that made my life very complicated and made me lose a lot of time that I could be investing in doing something better.

The ritual that I am unable to remove is something complex and it is something that I have to remove from my life as soon as possible because it is hurting me a lot in my life and it prevents me from progressing, the ritual consists of several parts an obsession with numbers along with an obsession with bad news that induces very negative thoughts in me.

(Warning potential trigger)
The habit begins when I want to start incorporating good habits into my life such as eating well, quitting pornography and more, so I decide that tomorrow I will start incorporating them but tomorrow is day 14 for example, then I decide that that day I will not start because that number I do not like that I was left as the day I started to change my life, many times that thought towards that number usually comes from bad news that has happened that day then I link that number with the bad news, that's why I try to avoid watching the news because if I don't want to link the bad news that comes out with the number of the day in which it is. If a bad news happens in that week I can't start either because I link the day I wanted to change my life with the week or month that the bad news happened.
This is so bad that it doesn't allow me to improve anything because I'm always on a loop looking for the perfect day even the perfect week or month that nothing bad happens to start new habits.

I am not able to solve it, I tried to convince myself that they are thoughts that lack of logic but this form does not help me to solve it and rarely helped me in other rituals, I do not know if exactly it is the fear that its going to happen bad things for having started that day something bad happened, in addition to this ritual compared to other rituals the moment of anxiety lasts a short time but this being a day that will always be there for the day that start changing my life that anxiety lasted me all the time and not go out until I start again with my bad habits.

Help please!!!," 

Hi all.

After my recent posts here, i decided to act upon the advice i got and just ignore the intrusions and not go into any compulsions, this has been hard, but it did lower the anxiety a bit.

Yesterday i had my best day in the last 2 weeks, until this morning.

I was giving my son his bottle with him on my lap, and sometimes he would accidentally touch my groin, and i would slowly reposition him so it wouldn't touch my groin. At some point he was standing upright on my lap and we were cuddling a bit, i gave him some kisses (in the neck) and nothing to crazy yet. but at some point i remember looking at him at i was getting thoughts like (how would he react to being abused?) (would it hurt him for life?) (would he be scarred for life?) (he looks so pure and lovely) etc etc. immediately after i felt this terrible feeling inside my stomach, why would i ask such questions in my head without trying to fight it (as i do with intrusions normally) i normally try to fight or block an intrusion of sometimes i shake my head as in (NO) that way i tell myself i don't want what im thinking.

But this time these thoughts came up and i sort of went with it. I did not actually think about abusing him (sexually) in pictures or how it would be done, but more if he would notice being abused? if he would be damaged by it? etc etc.

And now my mind is going crazy! why do i ask myself such questions? am i a monster?

fyi, i don't feel attracted to children, i never have. And i do have some sort of a past with pocd aswell. But this feels different because i did not fight the thoughts, i even asked myself certain question regarding the topic as i stated here. this makes me feel as if i want what i was thinking about.

How would one deal with this?

I know im doing compulsions right now about the situation that occurred this morning, but it feels as if it might be more important then something to just ignore. I really dont want my son to be hurt or molested or anything, but i hate that i get thoughts that ar not so much into detail about how but more about if.

something to note: i do ''daydream' alot and during these daydreams sometimes disturbing thoughts also come by, which i initially dont reject or ignore but sort of 'go with'. which makes me feel like afterwards that i really want those ''daydreams'' to happen since i did not reject them or ignore them.",OCD,1577187283,tunux,1,1,True,2019-12-24

I need clarity,"Hi everyone,
I just joined this reddit page.

OCD runs in my family. Myself, my dad, sister and my brother have it.

I learned I had it at the age of 21, where I would get these intrusive thoughts about something bad happening to my family while they were abroad so I had to do things a certain way and a number of times for those thoughts not to come to fruition.

I am 33 now, was stuck in a very toxic marriage that completely put my ocd in overdrive I started to develop severe anxiety along with symptoms that I could of swore is due to a physical illness (stroke like symptoms, chest tightness, head tingling, hand, feet and face numbness tingling, insomnia, suddenly feeling like I will die, major weight loss. I can keep going. 

I never had these symptoms before other than the OCD that I had most of my life.  To make a long story short, I left my toxic marriage and quit the horrible job I had and started antidepressants, I could finally say I can function like a normal person.

However OCD has never left me even with antidepressants, the physical sensations/symptoms lessened but do come back but not as often especially during stressful times.

I initially thought that me and my sister had OCD and not till I had a discussion with my dad and brother and they both have OCD, minus the physical sentations/symptoms that I had.

I‚Äôm here for clarity does anyone also get these physical symptoms along with their OCD. Also what has helped your OCD.

Out my comfort zone for the holidays,"I'm away from home for the next two days with my partner, visiting his family for the holidays. He locked up the house since I've been working all day, and picked me up. Our friends are going in each day to spend time with our pets and have dinner with them. They'll be locking up each night.

One of the things I obsessively check is our front door. It's gotten pretty severe since it was left unlocked and we had our apartment completely ransacked a few years ago, and two years before that the same thing happened except nothing was stolen; it was a man on a drug-fueled rage who physically attacked one of our pets. So it isn't unusual for me to be late to things or just outright skip them altogether because I've had to go home to check the door's locked.

My brain is going haywire. I have no way of knowing if it's been locked, if it'll be locked, and if I'm going to return to everything smashed up, looted and my animals hurt. Part of my brain is trying to justify spending ¬£80+ on getting a taxi from where we're  staying back to our home, and just calling off my stay.",OCD,1577209503,bunnybrambles,1,1,True,2019-12-24

Harm Ocd making me believe i WANT to do awful things.,"My mother is the most important person in my life. I love her very much and have always been very afraid of her dying even as a kid. Sometimes I'd check if she was breathing or not in the night.
But my ocd thoughts started happening a lot mote frequently a month ago and i feel disgusted in myself, i feel like shit all the time because of the intrusive thoughts.
My mind makes me think i'd do the things it makes me think but i would never do them and im scared i will not be able to bear these thoughts anymore and will think the only way to stop them is to carry them out. Which is something i never ever want to do but im only 20 years old and im scared shitless i'll do something i dont want to in the future. I dont want to have a family because i dont want to hurt them. Ever.
I dont want to think about these things anymore, they especially flare up when im alone or have just woken up. My breathing fastens and i feel very detached when im thinking about these thoughts, which scares me even more. I realise that i exist and that im thinking and looking at the mirror feels so weird, its like looking at a robot. I cant believe its me.

OCD/ADHD,"  Hey I just really needed to talk about this with some people that may understand and want to listen.  So in high school I was diagnosed with ADHD which does fit me but there was always something else to it you know? Later in adulthood I had a diagnosis of Autism that was done without my consent and by a practitioner that didn‚Äôt really get me/I didn‚Äôt click with.  I instantly rejected the Autism diagnosis, not because I have anything against people with autism but out of a desperate ‚Äòthat‚Äôs not what the issue is.‚Äô  

  Due to the fact I struggle with social situations sometimes people assumed I didn‚Äôt understand social situations.  I think I understand social situations really well (when I pay attention).  I can understand different perspectives really well and know what I am doing that is socially not a good idea such as talking too much about something, being too open etc.  I understand but struggle with the compulsion not to do these things and regret afterwards.  I feel like I‚Äôm set to 11 on things but everyone else is a 5s or 4s.  I get really into things and experience things strongly both for good or bad.  I‚Äôm glad I do though it makes relating to others harder because of the rush I get/feeling of enjoying something completely.

 When I was a kid my favorite thing to do was sorting things, I still enjoy doing so today.  I also would watch the same movies over and over again.  I obsessed about things and thought differently but was never really hyperactive.  I do ritualistic things of the more stereotypical sort of ritualistic behavior but was able to suppress them or distract myself because of my ADHD.  Or maybe it was that my fears are more socially related? For some reason people assume that they must be hygiene related.  My art has always been very detailed/obsessive. 

  I know what everyone says about self diagnosis  (and agree)and don‚Äôt presume to be a expert but since everyone has always obsessively trying to figure out what is wrong with me/fix me my whole life... I thought I might give it a try.  My issue is that I am very obsessive and compulsive in a social way due to fears of abandonment but not in the way they describe.  Looking things up I see articles talking as if having OCD and ADHD is impossible yet I seem to have a mix of both...

A question about ERP,"Hello everyone,

I've got a question about ERP. So basically I've had my first OCD outbreak at 18. Before was some dumb minor s\*\*\* that I didn't pay attention to. Did ERP, grinded for months, got rid of it. Anyway a new form of OCD arrived, same crap, though I haven't been noticing results. I don't know what type of OCD it is, but it's OCD patterns. Don't continue if you're susceptible to other's obsessions. Basically my obsessive thoughts are about donating money to charity. ""If you had 5mil$, you wouldn't donate more than 1mil$ to charity and you indirectly kill starving children by that."" - along those lines. Variations of it such as buying a game instead of donating exist but it's pretty much the same stuff, just different jam. Anyway, when I do ERP I feel massive guilt, not just anxiety. Before I felt anxiety and I was certain to continue ERP, but this is a different feeling altogether - there is still obviously massive anxiety, but there's a component of guilt as well. I don't do none of reassurance nor googling, that's toxic. I don't do rationalization or donating, since it's not me authentically donating out of good will - it's my OCD telling me to. It's hindering my university performance a bit and I'd like to get some advice about feelings of guilt - do I just do ERP like I did before?

OCD and Medication,"This may be unrelated but a recent article came out that I discovered just now with the association of a medication, I won't name, in association with neurological disorders has apparently been bringing side affects including depression, OCD, etc. It's not anything mental health related this medication but I am quite concerned it may have caused my OCD now. I don't want to stop taking due to the withdrawal affects. I'm now nervous to take them as well and have been taking for a long time, around 6 years. Can I wean off them?? I never had OCD symptoms when I first had them and only started getting symptoms about 2 years ago. But this could still have been caused by long term use of the prescribed medication. 

Apparently the FDA has actually took notice of it as well and there are petitions. I don't wanna say it's my OCD causing this speculation but there is actually articles on it. It's Christmas as well now so I have to wait until after to see a doctor and I take these everyday. 

My doctor also prescribed some benzodiapines to me today as well and now I'm just like nervous to take them too in general. But if it was this other medication in the first place should I come off?

my father loved to use graphic expressions and exaggerations while talking to me as a kid. he told me not to run in the house because i could ‚Äúsplit my head wide open‚Äù, and of course, every time i ran, whether it be in the house or even other places like PE at school i would get graphic images in my mind of my head splitting in half and my brain and skull and blood all going everywhere, and then i would get scared and want to stop running and hold my head together. i know, stupid right?? but i was like 5 years old and my father was basically god to me in that stage of my life since he always presented his words as law. another thing he loved to do was tell me not to touch things because i would ‚Äúget sick and die‚Äù, aaaaand of course that led to a contamination/washing compulsion, except that one stayed with me until i was around 14 years old and still sometimes come back to me as an 18 year old. l

i‚Äôm still living with my dad and he‚Äôs still doing shit like that but with more serious things like telling me anecdotes about how he knows people who‚Äôve been murdered for saying their political beliefs around people who disagree. of course i know if i tell people whether i lean left or right chances are they‚Äôre not going to hurt me, but it‚Äôs still there in the back of my mind and i get panic attacks whenever the topic of politics comes up. i‚Äôm so used to seeing everything he says as the absolute truth since i was raised that way. all it takes is one little seed of doubt from him and poof, a panic attack in situations where it really isn‚Äôt warranted and makes me look like an idiot.",OCD,1577252366,CrimsonTheDragon,2,1,True,2019-12-25
What does recovery feel like for you?,"I have pure obsessive OCD I feel like I'm in remission bcus lately I've been having some pretty good mental health. I still get intrusive thoughts thrown at me, but instead of boulders bring dropped they just feel like small pesky stones. Being on strong antidepressants helps, but also realizing that I don't have to constantly arguing with myself is doing most of the work. At the same time though I have to give myself small reminders that I am Not neurotypical, so as to keep away intrusive thoughts that I don't actually have OCD, but to also remind myself that I can't blindly trust every single one of my thoughts just bcus I'm feeling good. Between the peace I still need to combat the urge to argue with myself.

"Depressing obsession with movies, books, tv, stories","I am finding myself in obsessive loops similar in pattern to my more painful and horrifying ocd obsessions. The difference is that it is to do with stories that I feel emotionally connected to.

I've watched many movies that have made me sad before. This year I rewatched the LOTR trilogy and found myself in an obsessive depressive loop at the end, getting sad about the awful things that happened to characters, Googling, trying to reassure myself out of the sadness somehow, trying to get friends and family to reassure me.

Last Saturday I went to see the Rise of Skywalker, suspecting that I might be a bit glum to see the Skywalker saga end. Apparently I had no idea. Since then I am in a loop. I find myself getting sad about the fates of various characters, the end of the saga, obsessively talking to friends and family about it, obsessively googling reviews and people's opinions. I don't know what I'm looking for, I think im just searching for something that will make the sadness go away.

I don't know why I've been so shaken by fictional tragedy but it's like I can feel it in every inch of my soul. I had a similar but much shorter lived reaction to Rogue One. I sound insane to my partner and family because I won't stop talking about it. Because of the holiday break I won't see my therapist until later in January.

Im scared Im a pedophile (pocd),"Im a female teenager. Generally sexually I find taboo things attractive. I like rape, for example. I like thinking of me being pimped out or held as a sex slave. I like thinking of being forced to perform various sexual acts. This doesnt really translatw to real life though as I dont necessarily like doing those things.
Last summer I suddenly started getting horrible sexual thoughts about children. I couldnt make them go away. As far as I know, I was told i have intrusive thoughts and got and ocd diagnosis as well as meds which really helped. Thw thoughts got to an easily manageable level.
Since I stopped my medication a few months ago ive been doing a lot worse. The thoughts came back and theyre just as bad. Now I think I might be a pedo. If I genuinely come to that conclusion I will kill myself with no hesitation.
Ive started getting awful thoughts about me raping children. The odd thing is Im always in the perspective of a man and the child is a little girl. I hate it. It feels wrong and disgusting. But for me, the concept lf ""wrong"" in itself is arousing in a sexual context. I dont find children physically attractive. But I find the concept of taboo and wrongness arousing and I feel bad. I dont get a groinam response unless I start thinking of me doing things to an age approapriate partner as if its a child, I get anxious. But I still like the concept of power, powerlessness, rape and so on. I DO NOT FANTASIZE ABOUT RAPING CHILDREN. Dont get me wrong. I fantasize about myself getting forced etc. Im just,, confused. Im scared I might be a pedo. But then again it doesnt make sense. The only fantasies with minors Ive had are those who are +-1 year from myself.
I was masturbating today and thinking of semi fucked up stuff again and I kept getting these thoughts in my head of a man raping his little daughter. I always stopped when those thoughts started and kept going once I regained control. Id been horny for a day and really wanted to cum. The thing is, while it did cause me distress I didnt stop masturbating all together. Doesnt that make me a pedo then? I didnt masturbate to the child, I stopped and then begun again doing it to whatever else. But it kept coming back. Im just,,, scared. I have these awful thoughts constantly. And I dont like them. Im scared if I let them wander Ill actually be turned on even though Im anxious about them. It feels awful. What do I do?",OCD,1577264890,ihatethis12343212,8,1,True,2019-12-25

Anytime I get over one, I just jump to the next.
Right now I can‚Äôt stop thinking about how I laughed at an ableist joke a while ago. I feel so disgusting I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm reading on ableism to learn from my mistake but I feel like shit. I shouldn‚Äôt have laughed in the first place.

It‚Äôs so gross that I laughed; how would he feel? 
Now I have the need to expose myself to the world and tell everyone what I‚Äôve done. I get similar urges anytime I remember something bad about myself and I usually follow through, like this time.

Needing to vent,"I've been dealing with anxiety for the majority of my life. I remember having my first panick attacks at a young age. Like this isn't enough I've been faced with bullying, my parents got divorced when I was 14. My mom has/is ill, both physically and mentally but she's unaware of her mental stage. She's manipulative and everything is always, somehow, mine or someone elses fault. Due to this I have no relationship with her. I also suffer from OCD that takes different forms (eating disorder, HOCD, ROCD, health anxiety and so on). I also struggle with major performance anxiety both at work, socially, in my marriage and life in general. 

I've been eating meds for about 3 years and I'm currently trying my 3rd type of medicine. Fingers crossed this works. I've also started going to therapy which is a huge step because I've been so afraid that the therapist is going to confirm my ocd/anxeity. 

Sometimes an ocd/anxious thought hits me, it can be random or triggered, and that thought just consumes me. When stuck in this loop I feel so hopeless and I hate the fact that this is always with me. It makes me want to die some times, I'm not suicidal, but I just want this all to end. I want to live a life without ocd and anxiety but that does not feel possible. 

When I'm not anxious life is good. I have the best and most supportive husband ever, he's my rock, he keeps me sane I have a dad that's beyond words. I have a good job, I nice (but messy haha) home and I do feel happy, but then the anxiety kicks in and takes away all that goodness, all the blessings.

I'm weak &amp; existencial crisis (POCD),"I have been trying to fight my ocd, giving less importance to my thoughts and everything but I can't always move on...

I was having a wonderful morning and as soon as a cute young girl appears on TV, I get in panic and I begin to think if I'm attracted to her or not and I also have experience body sensations and I'm now in my room, cutting myself because I feel so dirty...

I have experiencing a bad pocd lately and now I can't get the image of the girl out of my head and I can't stop feeling like I'm actually attracted to her! I can't tell if this is real (I hope not) or just my ocd fooling me.

I just... This is hard... And it's fucking Christmas! Why am I liked this?

I'm disappointing my loved ones... I'm tired of this doubts in my head...

Can the brain really trick you to think you're attracted to someone when you're not?

I also have constant philosophical conundrums on this matter which makes me feel more like a p... I have so many intrusive thoughts that make me question If my ocd is actually real

- if pedoph-lia was accepted in society, would I be one? (like it happened with sexual orientation) 
- what is truly sexual attraction and why does it only involve people from a certain age?
- why sometimes older men like younger woman (20s) but not kids? (I get this intrusive thoughts when I see this in movies) 

I know these questions are awful but I am a overthinker and I'm always questioning the meaning of life! Before diagnosis, I was trying to find reasons to why I wasn't a p (based on biology and society rules) and all I got was worse...

Just venting because it's been so hard lately,"After being in therapy for ""anxiety"" for a number of years, my counselor recently suggested that much of what I am suffering from can be attributed to a worsening of my OCD (which I had terribly when I was a child -- also had/somewhat still have trich). She mentioned I am on a continuum of generalized anxiety/OCD.

Lately, I have been obsessed with trying to figure out which aspects are coming from what. I definitely have some contamination OCD. For example, I can't not wash my hands when I feel I need to or touch certain things, or I will be sick with anxiety. I also can't get into my bed without taking a shower. My husband isn't allowed to either, because otherwise we will contaminate the clean bed. When we bring luggage home from a vacation, I have to decontaminate the bags otherwise I will feel we are bringing foreign germs into the home. Being on planes makes me feel sick with anxiety that all of the germs are sinking into us and we will get sick. 

But aside from that, it seems I have some sort of thought pattern situation that sort of ties into perfectionism? For instance, I had a lawyer look over my business paperwork recently to make sure I had adequate insurance coverage. I am convinced he missed something and that there will be catastrophic consequences because I may have left out a detail about my business that could make all the difference. Because of this, I sometimes avoid paperwork/anything having to do with authority figures with my business because of the potential for a mistake. It sickens me to the core thinking about accounting, bookkeeping, making sure of proper paperwork (because WHAT IF...), etc. Right now, I am reading and re-reading and re-reading fearing that I am not typing this out just right, and that will cause a misunderstanding. Sending emails is difficult.

I've driven by client's houses to make sure I didn't burn them down by leaving their heat on. If I am boiling water for pasta, I get intrusive thoughts about fearing putting my dogs (my babies, my most precious things in the whole wide world to me) in the water. Terrible.

But I guess the biggest thing/debilitating problem for me is professional mistakes. If and when I make a mistake or anything I've perceived to be a mistake, I will ruminate and play the situation over and over and over and over trying to resolve it or reconcile it in my head. For hours and hours, days on end. To the point of physical illness...like the level of cortisol pumping through my body is absolutely awful. Once I've made a mistake, I can't do anything good for myself (won't eat my favorite foods, get myself anything, do my hair) until it's resolved -- usually by ruminating or getting foolproof confirmation that someone isn't mad at me. 

I've realized I have serious, serious workaholism problems because it helps distract me. Until it doesn't, and I just worry about professional mistakes instead of interpersonal ones.

I am so worn down. I have been on buspirone, but it doesn't help the thoughts, so my doctor started me on a low dose Prozac. Just can't believe I'm at the point in my life where I'm on two medications. Here's to hoping it helps. Thank you for reading.",OCD,1577300238,inmypocket1,0,1,True,2019-12-25

Will anything bad happen if I don't do my compulsions? Please answer quickly.,"Disclaimer: I may not even have OCD, but I thought this sub was the most fitting. I am not asking for a diagnosis.


 Possibly triggering, idk, it's just an explanation of my types of compulsions: Okay, so, I get compulsions, and sometimes I can't do the compulsions, sometimes I feel like *another* person has do it, without me even asking, mostly, sometimes it's me trying to predict the future, and sometimes I don't even know what my compulsion is, so I fear doing it wrong. Sometimes I just don't have the energy, but hey, I don't want my family to die and all of that, so I use that energy I don't have.

Except me possibly getting worried, would anything bad actually happen if I didn't do the compulsions all of the time?

I know the answer might be obvious, but I still want to know the answer since it's stressing me out to have to do these compulsions. If it anything bad actually will happen, I'll want a quick answer so that I can pay attention and do all of my compulsions.",OCD,1577306680,Starshineactivism,7,1,True,2019-12-25

Overthinking dating...,"TL:DR snapping a girl who showed interest at a pre who I don‚Äôt talk to much.

Thought I‚Äôd post this here as you guys may have had similar experiences.

My group and Her group have recently started talking and meeting up and we‚Äôve had some really good pre‚Äôs and things to parties.
I hadn‚Äôt spoken to her until one of these pre‚Äôs for our schools Halloween party but had had a small crush on her all year. 

Essentially we arrived and someone cam up to me and said ‚Äòhey G you should get with B I heard she likes you‚Äô.
I laughed it off because it was still early.

We all sat down later and realized there weren‚Äôt enough seats and someone joked saying someone could sit on another‚Äôs lap. Someone then said ‚Äòoh G (me) could sit on Bs lap.‚Äô She then replied laughing saying ‚Äògo in then‚Äô and laughed it off again.

We were then getting a taxi to the dance which she happened to be in by which part we were all drunk, when she said;  ‚Äòhey G I‚Äôm putting some lipstick on do you want any?‚Äô Which I agreed to before flirting with her a b. More before arriving. It was at this point we arrived at the venue and I didn‚Äôt see her again for the rest of the night.

My question is was she interested? Was she just saying some of this stuff to be funny or what? I‚Äôve only dated one person so I‚Äôm pretty inexperienced.

Would it be weird to reply to one of her stories? She sometimes posts selfies and has been posting more recently, but I live in a pretty small community and am pretty out of her league so idk if people would take the piss out of me if i messaged her. Am I looking into it Too much?

What do you do if most of your worst ocd fears came true?,"About 75% of mine came true.   The only upside I can see is it broke me of the silly ones, like not eating parts of food I touched(started after getting very sick from eating at work one day, and ingesting something toxic I worked with).  Germaphobia, constant fear of illness/cancer/diseases etc.  Fear I was going insane(I was, just not the kind I thought, and it didn't matter in the end).  Fear of failing my parents.   Fear of people hurting me or using me.   I made the connection between intrusive thoughts and anxiety attacks about 12 years ago when they first got bad.    I never came across ocd though and just coped by shutting down.  

It reminds me of the joke about just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they aren't out to get you.  I have fairly serious ptsd now.   It would be funny, what do you call it when you have paranoid ocd, and compulsive caregiving but are also living under 24/7 video and audio surveillance in every room your worst abuser uses to make sure you don't say anything against them, while your life implodes and you're trying to take care of a girlfriend who has violent meltdowns, panic attacks and is also quite abusive, typically verbally and mentally but also insists she'll be killed if you ask her to leave and has no one to rely on but you.

Finally making sense of it all,"Hi all,

After reading a number of posts on this subreddit, I really identify with a lot of the experiences shared here and I feel that I can finally describe something that I have been suffering from this for almost as long as I can remember (I'm 23 and have never been to see a mental health professional). It has manifested differently in subject matter and has ebbed and flowed in its intensity.

For so many years I have been held back frankly terrifying spirals into cycles of worry and fear. This has translated into extremely low self confidence, which I do a good job of hiding but causes me psychological pain. I can't shake the feeling that it appears to have stunted me cognitively over the years, affecting my academic and social performance. Sometimes, this thought process reveals itself in a 'scatter-brained' act (i.e. I might forget to turn the stove off as I am so deep in a cycle of worry). From the outside I appear competent (mostly) and high achieving, but I have always felt that the true 'me' has been subservient to irrational fears and invasive thoughts. I have always felt inferior to those around me due to a conception that I am 'weak' for giving into these 'thought-traps', while they are somehow strong (and therefore more competent, worthy and will ultimately be better than me i.e. everything appears to be a zero-sum game that I will inevitably lose as my intelligence and sense of security rests on such a weak foundation). I also suffer from significant indecisiveness, which I am sure stems from this.

All this considered, I begin today with a new perspective. I didn't know that there was something to tackle until today, I suppose, but I have the resolve to confront this head on if it is possible to do so. I suppose it's not going away anytime soon, but I feel a sense of relief to be able to it into words.

wicked intrusive thoughts this christmas,"I really want to get help from a qualified therapist but there aren't too many in my area that take my insurance.  often the ones I have contacted say they are booked.  Some of them at advertise on Psychology Today - but they say they specialize in more of the OCD that is like ""skin picking"" / hair pulling (sorry I forgot the formal term) type.  

I'm sorry if this offends people but I am sharing from my heart of my real suffering.  I have this obsession with the middle finger -- and imagining that people are sitting on it as a form of punishment.  Back maybe 20 years ago, I told a few people off and gave them the finger and said ""sit on it"" and I really hadn't done this  but last summer (2018), these wicked intrusive thoughts started coming to me. I started imagining people I perceived as my enemies being forced to sit on that finger in sort of a religious ritual.   I have not actually told anyone directly - go sit on it but whenever I get upset its a persistent thought.  I have told people about this obsession -- like my mom and I have started to tell a therapist, but he is more of a general talk therapist.  

I also have terrible obsessions about the Catholic Church - specifically pope francis (and also Islam and Muhammad).   though I do not identify as catholic, I went to a catholic church for 5 PM service tonight.  I started thinking that I was sexually abused by a priest when I was a kid.  I have had delusional thinking about this in the past. In reality I don't think it happened.  I was also thinking that Pope Francis needs to be f--ed in the ass, as well as other people.   When I got home after going out to eat I started violently rocking in my office chair  and sticking up both middle fingers -- telling people to sit on them.  These people were not present. I was just imagining people being there.

I've always liked imagining myself as a boy, and specially feel turned on imagining myself as male having sex, but when I think of it in a way of actually thinking I am a boy in real life I don't feel turned on, just anxious and weird, and I don't feel then need to go on testosterone/medically transition/do surgeries.

I am seeing a therapist but I'm really scared to talk to her about it, I don't feel comfortable telling her that, and I have no one IRL to talk about this so I'm trying my best looking for answers online, but I haven't came to a conclusion and it's making me have anxiety crisis and want to cry and isolate myself to the point people are noticing it. I just don't know what I'm making up and what I'm genuinely questioning.

I know this is stupid but I can't sleep without it,"Never posted before and I'm on mobile. (Not good at grammar I'm sorry)

Okay so Christmas is already stressful but this year wasn't the worst it's been. I've been scatter brained and I'm exhausted from working two jobs up to 12 or more hours a day, and I went to spend Christmas Eve and Christmas with my mother so I brought all my essentials. In those essentials are my childhood blanket, my few small stuffed animals and my green pillow with an inner pillow that has my grandmothers pillowcase on it that she made for me. And I'm not joking when I say I've had the pillow sense I was 5 or younger, I have never slept without it and I forgot it today at my mother's house and she's about an hour and a half away from me and I have to be awake in a few hours to work my jobs. My body is starting to hurt because of the stress of not having it even though I know it's just a pillow. I already suffer from insomnia, sleep paralysis, chronic nightmares practically anything bad with sleeping I've delt with it. My pillow is one of my comforters the way the fabric feels and if I have a nightmare I always just sleep with my head under it and I physically don't know how to sleep without it. I've never been professionally diagnosed with anything because my parents never liked doctors, but when I was younger they thought I had Asperger's and I'm currently going to a therapist for childhood trama and he's even said that he's certain I have something along those lines but he's not able to fully diagnosed with anything. IDK I guess this is just more of a rant because I just don't know what to do. I'm so stressed out and about to cry I feel so stupid that I forgot it.

Advice on traveling/staying in new places?,"For the first time since my contamination ocd diagnosis I'm going to have to travel. It's by plane, which of course is absolutely filthy contamination-wise. It's a 3 week camp.

Is this normal? Husband is telling me what his therapist says about me.,"This is actually the third time this has happened, 3 different therapists.

The first time was in 2010 maybe when he went and spoke with my therapist I had had since 1998 or so. He told me that she told him that I was the problem, not him. I was really upset that she would say this and I didn't really believe it, or want to believe it, but later that therapist reacted strangely to me about an unrelated topic that made me wonder, so I stopped seeing her.

The second time was when we got marriage counseling, which didn't really go far because she didn't know anything about OCD but was ""willing to muddle through it with me if I wanted."" I didn't want that but I thought she could still help us communicate. He went to see her without me and then told me that she had said that I was the problem, not him.

This time he is seeing a therapist without me (though I have no proof he's really seeing her, and this one is actually a doctor of psychology). He tells me she has diagnosed me as borderline personality and that I need inpatient treatment for my OCD and prozac. 

??? 

A doctor wouldn't do that would they?? 

I have seen a psychologist before who dismissed me quickly and decided I had BPD after about 20 minutes into our first meeting. It was upsetting how she treated me, but I don't believe she would have diagnosed someone she'd never seen at all.

Should I try psychiatric medication if I have obsessions about it and paranoia about pharmacological treatment?,"I'm diagnosed with OCD, GAD, and ASD. I wasn't diagnosed until I took it upon me to start therapy when I was 22 despite struggling since early childhood, because my parents were and still are neglectful. They never get visited by doctors, even for physical health, and fully believe all doctors only exaggerate and give you unnecessary treatment for normal issues. I've been taught that whatever I'm struggling with isn't really a big deal, I'm just exaggerating. They thought this would make me confident.

I've been struggling much worse than usual these past months. My heart rate has been insane from panic, even when I'm not emotionally feeling panicked, it still beats too fast and I can't breathe well. I often shake and need a few days to a week to get back to a normal breathing and heart rate. A year ago I started self harming again (I used to do it as a child, then stopped without any intervention at all) by hitting myself. In the past three months it intensified and I haven't gone more than five days without doing it, and not even one without feeling the urge to do it. My therapist suggested replacement behavior but I'm struggling to actually do that. I keep relapsing. It's very hard not to self harm in public when I get the urge.

I've been considering seeing a psychiatrist and trying medication for the first time, but I'm worried about it being beneficial at all. I'll explain why, I posted about this a few times here already but I want to make sure I explain everything in one post.

I've switched obsession themes a lot and my primary one right now is worry about faking OCD. I hit myself in response to thoughts of not having it bad enough, but even the way I do it feels fake because it's not serious, I've never sent myself to the hospital. So it's not even a real problem and am making it all up.

I have sudden thoughts of other people's mental suffering and it reminds me that I actually have no real problems and am just being insulting other people's experiences by thinking i could ever even say I've struggled with mental illness. I keep debating this with myself in my head, making points and counterpoints and comparisons and researching. Every single media I've consumed for a couple months now is chosen exclusively on the fact that I can use it as a measure to compare my own pain and understand if it's real or not. I can at least safely say that i think about mental illness 24/7.

Those thoughts of other people's suffering are so painful and remind me that everything I've been through is normal. If I really had it that bad then my parents or teachers would have had no choice but to seek help for me and I would have been prescribed medication inevitably. Maybe I should have never even gone to therapy, the fact that I decided to go is even more proof that clearly I didn't have it bad enough or I wouldnt have been able to do that on my own. I clearly never had it that bad because I never had any extreme behaviors, If i was neglected it's because i wasn't suffering for real. I even failed at being a shut in, I dont injure myself enough, I dont have enough panic attacks, my compulsions don't impair my functioning enough, I even failed at dropping out of college despite struggling at it and hating it. I always felt so fake for making progress without medication so far.

Because of this, I'm scared of trying medication even if maybe it could help. First of all, my therapist doesn't believe it will, simply because of the fact that I have so many anxieties about it. I am skeptical of psych meds' efficacy and also paranoid about the side effects (I lost 20kgs the past year, I live in fear of being overweight again so I refuse to take anything that might cause weight gain, and reading about the possible other side effects will make me paranoid and scared that I might experience them. The thought of a pill doing things inside of me and messing up with my brain and making me different is terrifying.)

When I research them, I feel like I am appropriating mentally ill people's struggles and am faking because this all feels so serious and my functioning isn't impaired enough and don't deserve them, I'll be a bad person if I do. I've been claiming this struggle as my own for so long only to feel special while other people suffer for real.

Besides, I'm terrified that if this goes away and I truly feel better then i'll have completely faked my suffering. Feeling good is a trigger for thoughts about faking. I self harm the most when I've had a good day, because if I have a good day it's proof that I'm not suffering or I wouldnt have any good days.

I'm scared that I want to see a psychiatrist only for reassurance that I really am mentally ill, because after all everyone can see a therapist, not just the mentally ill, so the therapy doesn't feel ""validating"" enough.

I think about it 24-7, I get up in the night to shine a light down my throat and try to clean it which both hurts and makes me gag until I throw up sometimes. I really need help.

"Why, hello, everyone. I could use a helping hand...","Hello, guys. Imma tell you a little story: I'm a teen who lives in a stereotypical family where mental illnesses are rather stigmatized.

I do have to admit though, that with so many series, books, messages, etc. that try to give information about these problems, quite a weird phenomenon is carried within: Kids from younger age ranges tend to feel ***identified***, and over the course of time, they will grow with the false rooted idea that they, indeed, have said illnesses.

I sometimes go into that scenario, where everything I am feeling is just a product of my own mind, trying to convince itself that I suffer from one of these illnesses.

I've already investigated a lot about OCD, because I have seen some patterns similar to those described by medical websites, videos, etc., just as much as I've told myself things along the lines of ""Nah, you don't have hygiene obsessiveness. Most prolly just a stretch""; but without counting with enough money to go to an actual psychiatrist to make some studies, I thought it wouldn't be bad to ask some people who do have been diagnosed therewith.

This will of course not count as the word from an expert psyc, but an informed idea is better than ignorance. 

I don't know if these counts as the *medical advice* that both, the first and second rules of this subreddit prohibit (it probably does), but I might as well give it a shot.

My case.,"Okay, I really don‚Äôt know how to put this, so Imma write what comes to my mind.
First, does anyone ever feel an urge to have everything in an exact place in an exact position all the time? Or the urge to have the same stereo volume  number every time? I do, it would help to have anyone to talk about this. So, for example, I love Rubik‚Äôs cubes, and I have my shirt collection on my drawer, I always like to have them all with the blue face facing me, green face looking at the window, and white face on top, all gathered in a rectangular shape, but, I always get in a madness rage when at least one cube is not in the position I like it to be in, and I get triggered to a whole new level, maybe this is not important but I wanted to say it. 
Also, when I‚Äôm always hearing music on a Stereo I always have to have the volume number on 21, don‚Äôt know why, but if it isn‚Äôt there I start to get nervous and start to touch my fingers in a repetitive way which helps me calm down. 
I‚Äôm also obsessed with security and rules, if someone doesn‚Äôt follow the rules I just start screaming at them the rule they‚Äôre breaking, that‚Äôs just me I guess. Same with security, if I feel something or someone is in danger I do the same thing with my fingers, and my mind starts to race on the endless possibilities.
I‚Äôm almost finished, I hope this isn‚Äôt long.
Lastly, I don‚Äôt know if anyone else feels this, but whenever I hear someone say for example: I have depression/anxiety/any mental disorder, I go off to a whole new level for me, I start arguing and getting mad, to the point that what comes out of my mouth I can‚Äôt control anymore. 
So I guess that‚Äôs it for me, I hope that whoever manages to reach this post can be someone I can talk about the things I mentioned and some other things.

VERY IMPORTANT POINTERS.,"Hello,
Let me begin by saying that we are one of the weirdest and elite batches of humankind. We are people who're scared of the things which are in our heads and which aren't real. We deal with problems by ourselves and yet we live life. 
To Everyone, never quit. Never. You know why? Cause OCD is a sham. And it'll do whatever it can to keep you busy. The only way to defeat this disorder is by cutting off the compulsions completely and the main troublemaker is ""Reassurance"", now get that in deep. ""Reassurance"" and other ""rituals"" are the only
things that keep this alive.  
Anxiety isn't the problem, compulsions are.

These are some pointers that work for me given to me by my doc.
""These thoughts are not yours and you don't need to take the responsibility to deal with them"",
""These thoughts are just chemicals produced just because of the deficiency of certain brain chemicals"" ""These thoughts soon become controllable as these chemical levels are regained"" 
""Even if the thought persists, do not engage""

Yes I know it isn't simply the chemical view, there are other deep things behind it. But trust me, get these pointers in your head, it works.

I want everyone in this subreddit to be healthy and 
happy, always. And I'll be there to help.

‚ÄúWhat if I had one in my eye all this time? Maybe I was lucky and didn‚Äôt catch one vaginally anally or orally but I was unlucky and did have it in my eye?

Have I been doing ERP wrong?,"(Note: I don't have a therapist, so I have been doing this without professional supervision.)

Hi all! (First post, yay!) I have POCD which gets worse around certain times of my menstrual cycle (this is one of those times) and recently I've done a week-long 'no-reassurance seeking' challenge. I thought it was going well, but as the week went on, though my intrusive thoughts stopped, I kept having this underlying anxiety that I really am what my OCD says I am. This happened the last time I really tried to commit to ERP as well, and I found that the moment I stepped away from it I was able to stop thinking about it unless if I encountered a trigger in the real world. 

I've been trying to continue my ERP through this week, but I keep finding that I can't resist compulsions for even the smallest exposures now, and I hate making myself think about my triggers when I know perfectly well that I could just be going about my life were I not trying to actively expose myself. Not to mention that I've started really feeling the jolts of anxiety again, and my OCD keeps telling me I'm forcing them. It's a whole mess. 

The method of ERP I've been using is to think the words: ""I'm a \[blank\]"" and try not to react, but, as you can see, I can't even type it out for fear that it'll come true, so it's not going great. 

Am I doing ERP wrong? Have I done my hierarchy wrong? Are there any other therapies for OCD that I can try?

Obssesing over weed and feeling good,"So Im having trouble with weed. I think im obssesive with it and that it kind of serves as a compulsion. So I start the day, occasionaly thinking about weed, thinking whether I should smoke or not at home in the evening. The problem is that ive got plenty of uni stuff to do, plus the weed doesnt really give me relief. I feel high but not necessarily calm, get anxious and paranoid from time to time. Also it drives me away from being present.

The thing is that im afraid not to smoke because then the OCD thoughts are more intense or feel more intense. Plus everytime I smoke I wake up feeling hazy in the morning and I dont like it . Also feel ashamed for smoking. I wanna stop but Im afraid of the anxiety that will come from my ocd.

I want to stop also because I want to give myself time for yoga and meditation or things that really are relaxing and not just a bad habbit that is not healthy to me eventually. Wish I could smoke just occasionaly but its hard to maintain.

Living in fear for two years. Please give me advice. Started from smoking weed.,"Hello everyone, I will try and keep this post as brief as possible and hit only the key points. Two years ago I smoked weed at college with some ‚Äúfriends‚Äù. I had an absolutely horrible (terrifying) experience. I had never really smoked weed. This included the worst panic attack I have ever had in my life. I had very bad chest pain from my heart. This resulted in me going to the emergency room because my heart was beating so fast. I was convinced I had smoked laced weed and damaged my brain permanently. Ever since this experience I have never felt the same. My anxiety has been through the roof. I constantly worry that I have a major mental illness like schizophrenia or borderline personality disorder. I think I could potentialy be in the prodromal phase of schizophrenia. Could the weed have unlocked something in my mind? I have went to several doctors and psychiatrist who have assured me that I do not have schizophrenia. However, it‚Äôs as if my mind can‚Äôt accept what they say. I still worry I have something majorly wrong with me. My psychiatrist believes that I have major depressive disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder. I worry that I have an illness that has not yet been discovered. I live in a constant state of worry. I am constantly (hours on end a day for two years) researching symptoms and reading forum post of people with a variety of mental illness.

Obsessed with old compulsions,"When I was first diagnosed with OCD, I was mostly experiencing stereotypical ‚Äúquirky‚Äù symptoms, like tapping and counting. I didn‚Äôt know much about OCD, and nobody (including my therapist) ever told me about things like violent intrusive thoughts or false memories.

When I started experiencing these symptoms, I didn‚Äôt know what they were.

I would compulsively read books or look up stories online that graphically portrayed similar themes to my intrusive thoughts, to try to ‚Äútrigger‚Äù my false memories into something more solid, so I could know for sure whether they happened. I would read these things, and feel horrified/ morbidly fascinated, and then disgusted with myself for reading them. I still wouldn‚Äôt be certain about the ‚Äúmemories,‚Äù so I‚Äôd do it again. It became a cycle.

I have since learned that these were OCD compulsions, and I no longer do this. However, I now find myself obsessing over the fact that I used to read these things, and I feel deeply ashamed and angry with myself. Intellectually, I know that I didn‚Äôt commit a crime or hurt anybody, and that fiction isn‚Äôt reality, but these themes stand so strongly against my morals that I feel regret for interacting with the material at all.

"new to this sub, looking for advice on how to cope","this might be long, but i‚Äôm going to try to sum up my 24 years of life so far. i‚Äôm just looking for some hope.
 
backstory:

i‚Äôve always been an ‚Äúworry wart‚Äù. a hypochondriac if you must.

as a child, i remember always having something on my mind to fret about. for a specific example, i once gave a friend whose was sick with chicken pox a toy but was then scared to receive it back with the fear that i too would contract the chicken pox from that toy.

my teenage years, i excelled in school, honors classes and straight As because my parents enforced it upon me, they didn‚Äôt want me to end up working at a job i hate like they do. i had a lot of pessimistic views and it cost me to lose a lot of friends as a teenager, which i took very hard because i am sensitive person.

as a young adult i‚Äôve been a mess. i‚Äôve had a lot of crappy, underpaid jobs because it‚Äôs hard for me to stay at a place i can‚Äôt bear to even show up to. i tried to go into the military for past couple of years in hopes that it would ‚Äúset me straight‚Äù, give me a sense of direction, and allow me to travel/escape my cesspool of a hometown. my entire family really instilled that i should join the military, as they did not have the funds to send me to college. 

now, i still live in my hometown, working at a state government job with good benefits but very low pay and being 24, i‚Äôm starting to really panic that this is ‚Äúit‚Äù for me. i take classes at a local community college but i‚Äôve switched my major several times and i‚Äôm still unsure of what it is that i want to even really do. i don‚Äôt have children and don‚Äôt really plan to but i do have a partner who is great and who i have been with for several years now. 

my parents always warned me about not being held back in ‚Äúbeing in love‚Äù, and to pursue every opportunity i can while i‚Äôm young. now that i‚Äôm ending my early 20s, they‚Äôve calmed down a lot but i can‚Äôt help but think i‚Äôm totally failing at life and that this could be it for me because i don‚Äôt know how to get ahead any farther.

if you‚Äôre still reading, this is the part where my OCD comes into play:

it just occurred to me in the past couple of months that i am severely suffering OCD, and probably have been my entire life and it‚Äôs just getting worse. 
i always assumed it was just ‚Äúnormal anxiety‚Äù, as my parents brushed off all of my worries growing up, telling me to ‚Äúsuck it up and be strong‚Äù.

i have a huge fear of germs, but specifically germs that cause vomiting. i am an emetephobe and it‚Äôs led me to exhausting daily rituals. obsessive hand washing, cleaning/disinfecting things my hands come into contact with constantly, never eating things i‚Äôve touched with my hands, etc.
this fear stemmed from my mother, who is the same way. coworkers at my jobs make fun of me for how i am about ‚Äúcleanliness‚Äù and ‚Äúgerms‚Äù. i think that everything is always contaminated with the worst viruses imaginable. 

i get very fixated on routines, for example like having to vacuum my house every single day or i feel a sense of guilt and failure. i can‚Äôt stand dirtiness.

i always thought i was a ‚Äúperfectionist‚Äù because of the stigma around mental health, but it‚Äôs dawning on me that i suffer obsessive controlling thoughts constantly. i always feel i need things to go certain way, or be a specific certain way, otherwise it leads me to become very discouraged and stressed. like i always HAVE to have something to be worried about, and there‚Äôs never a happy medium. there will always be something my brain wants to obsess over and fixate on. 

i guess basically i am finally putting the pieces of the puzzle together about my nerves and anxiety, and i think it‚Äôs all stemming from OCD and maybe it‚Äôs been passed down to me genetically from my mother? 

i feel it‚Äôs really limiting me, and holding me back.

lately i‚Äôve been struggling with every day things. everything seems like a challenge, and mentally exhausts me to the point where by the end of the day, i want to collapse. but i don‚Äôt allow myself to relax because every time i try to, i think of something that i need to get up and go do. i can‚Äôt even help it.

it‚Äôs getting bad and it‚Äôs leading me to feeling a constant panic. 

i can‚Äôt focus on my job or schoolwork, it‚Äôs leading to physical symptoms of dizziness and clumsiness because i feel really off balance.
i‚Äôm always so tense, my joints pops all of the time and clenching my jaw gives me headaches almost daily. my blood pressure goes up and my heart races. OH, and not to mention i‚Äôve suffered from IBS my entire life which i know my gut is linked to my nervous brain.
i feel like i can‚Äôt get out of bed, but i do, because i have to of course, but it is so draining.

i don‚Äôt know if i should go to my doctor with this, but if i did i wouldn‚Äôt even know where to start. i‚Äôve never in my life talked to a doctor about my mental health because of the fear that i would be prohibited from joining the military. but i‚Äôm desperate. 

i‚Äôm sorry this has been so much rambling i‚Äôm not even sure if this will make sense at this point.. my brain won‚Äôt calm down enough for me to focus. 

TLDR: my nerves and obsessive thoughts are ruling over me, making me feel hopeless and i feel like this is no way to live a life. i just want to be able to enjoy things like a normal person without the racing ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù thoughts. i am a mess, and feeling defeated. and i am DESPERATE for a moment of clarity/peace/confidence but i can‚Äôt find it, and i can‚Äôt even help it because my brain will not allow it. i just need some relief so i can try to live a somewhat normal life, and not always feel like i‚Äôm late to the entirety of life.",OCD,1574262275,indigo_floyd,1,1,True,2019-11-20

"I Have OCD especially lots of Pure O, I have sexual Fantasies that have become Intrusive thoughts","Basicly I have OCD at this point in my life Mostly Pure O when I was a child had more of the classic OCD style Obessions followed by compulsions.  Recently Some of what I think are Sexual fantasies that are sort of wierd and Taboo (nothing related to pedophilia or rape or harmful to anyone)  like two consenting Adults sexual stuff but its defiantly Taboo.  I basicly get these thoughts stuck in my head and can't stop thinking about it, just loops around.  Constantly have to use porn a lot.

I noticed when I just own up and tell my GF about them and masturbate to them they loose their thrill and it dies down. Part of me believes they are OCD thoughts since I don't know if I necessarily thought about them a lot before just pop up and then I get a taste of them if that makes sense.

intrusive thoughts about time loops has caused me to have delusions that I am in a time loop?,"So this has been one of my obsessive thoughts for the past 4-5 days. Every time I notice anything reoccurring in my life, I start into a thought spiral about how I am stuck in a time loop. For example: I was walking into work and noticed that the Impeachment hearings were playing on the TV. Then I think to myself ""omg this happened yesterday"", and fall into a thought loop on how everything I'm experiencing has already happened. 

It is a constant loop, and sometimes I actually believe that this is my reality, like *genuinely* believe that I have gone so insane that all perception of reality has been lost and I have transcended the reality of time. Even writing about it is triggering the thought loop.

I suspect I may have trans OCD,"I actually made this post to r/questioning, but figured it might also belong here.

 

&gt;So I'm 22 years old, AMAB, and I generally think I'm okay with that. In the last couple of months, however, I've had some stuff on my mind in regards to my gender identity. I'm not sure if I'd call it full-blown questioning more than I would call it nagging doubts.  
&gt;  
&gt;A bit of background: I'd say my I had a typical male childhood. I was pretty happy to do typical boy stuff and don't really recall any ""signs"" that I could be trans. I was never super macho or anything, but definitely a far cry from effeminate. Sure, I did and still do question and/or feel dissatisfied with certain male gender norms, and have definitely been curious, even envious about certain aspects of femininity, but overall was pretty content identifying and presenting as male.  
&gt;  
&gt;About 2 or 3 years ago I discovered the feminization kink online, and something about it just got me going. Pretty quickly I found myself masturbating to that kind of stuff frequently. Never hardcore videos or anything, mostly captioned images, hentai, erotic comics, that sort of stuff. A little while later I also started experimenting with crossdressing, mostly just trying on clothes that used to belong to my older sister. This went on for a few years until a couple of months ago when I stumbled across [r/egg\_irl](https://www.reddit.com/r/egg_irl/). Scrolling through the sub briefly, I saw quite a few memes conflating behaviors like crossdressing and feminization fetishes with being trans. So I kinda freaked out. Suddenly I was in a panic, frantically looking up stuff about gender dysphoria and trans narratives to try and figure out if they applied to me. None of it really fit, which should have been a relief to me, but a lot of transgender message boards that I visited, such as [r/asktransgender](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/). had a pretty vocal portion of the community pushing a ""If you have to ask, you're probably trans/Cis people don't question"" narrative. So I wound up an utter mess of trying to piece myself back together, basically in a paranoid state of wondering if I had been a woman my whole life and just hadn't realized it, and that I was in some deep state of denial and had successfully buried those feelings for 22 years. Frankly, this made absolutely no sense to me, seeing as how, as I mentioned before, I hadn't really had any real discomfort with my sex or any real desire to be the opposite sex, but I was stuck in this feedback loop and couldn't pull myself out.  
&gt;  
&gt;After a few weeks I started seeing a therapist. Not gender-specific, just a general sort of therapist. He agrees that I don't seem to show any signs of gender dysphoria, which came as a relief to me, but the thoughts and worries still plagued me for another week or two afterward before subsiding.  
&gt;  
&gt;For another 3 or 4 months I didn't even really think about it again until a few weeks ago when it suddenly started back up, less intense, but still distressing. I think I'm on my way into another lull period now. When I get like that though, I'm utterly terrified that I might be uncomfortable with my body and need to transition, but I also really don't want to. Not just because of the potential consequences in regards to how it may affect my relationships, but because I feel like it conflicts with the person I think I am. But then there come the thoughts that I might just be in denial and that the only way forward is to transition. It's kind of a vicious cycle. I understand that, ultimately, stuff like my gender identity is something that only I can define for myself. I guess I just want some feedback from someone who has been down that road before.

I'd like to note that I have been talking with my therapist about potential OCD diagnosis, but he doesn't seem convinced because, while I do show obsessions, I don't really have any clear compulsions. We've also discussed GAD as well as autistic obsessions (I've previously been diagnosed with Asperger's), but those don't quite seem to fit for me.",OCD,1574276244,Not_A_Username_Four,5,1,True,2019-11-20

First let me clear up they have nothing to do with pedophile, rape or anything violent its between two consenting adults.  I have just wierd taboo sexual thoughts that I want to do with my GF.  Part of me doesn't like these thoughts since they are very taboo.  I would try to just not think about it and block it which made way worse since it became a forbiden fruit before but then it got to a point where they consumed my day and I would masturbate 2-3 times a day to them or look at a lot of porn (sometimes 2-3 hours a day).  I told my GF one of my fantasies recently and shes very open sexually and she said it was fine and she liked it and glad to play it out the idea atleast in conversation (long distance relationship) which helped a lot since I felt a lot of shame sometimes about the fantasies.  Part of me believes that they will make things worse with GF and she will view me different worse, or weak because of them and leave me. I have a lot of shame about them since I grew up by a conservative and catholic family where man is suppose to be strong and conservative and most of the fantasies are on the submissive side.

She suggested that I may have a personality disorder but told me that I probably don't and suggested that I find another therapist...
Now I can't stop obsessing over whether or not  I have a personality disorder. I think it could actually be possible but a lot of the symptoms of anxiety, depression and ocd seem similar to certain personality disorders so I don't know.

Obsessing over past compulsions,"When I was first diagnosed with OCD, I experienced symptoms like tapping, counting, and checking objects (like the stove.) I didn‚Äôt know anything about intrusive thoughts or false memories, so when these symptoms developed, I didn‚Äôt recognize them as part of my disorder.

In order to test whether these thoughts and memories were ‚Äúreal,‚Äù I would read books and online stories that graphically depicted the same kinds of scenarios I was imagining. I thought that I might trigger myself into remembering something more clearly, and I would know for sure if it happened.

I would force myself to read these stories, and then feel guilty and sick afterward. But since I still didn‚Äôt have a solid grip on a ‚Äúmemory,‚Äù I would do it again, and it became a cycle.

I know now that these were compulsive behaviors, and that these ‚Äúmemories‚Äù were OCD-related intrusive thoughts. I don‚Äôt read these things anymore, but now I find myself ruminating over the fact that I used to. I feel deeply ashamed, even though I know intellectually that I didn‚Äôt do anything illegal, or hurt anyone. And I know that fiction is not reality.

The point is that I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it.

Obsessing/Fearing Suicide and Depression (Health Anxiety?),"So I‚Äôve had GAD for about 2 years,health anxiety for the better part of a year, and have had varying degrees of OCD throughout my life. 

In the last 6 months or so I‚Äôve had mini episodes of worrying about a specific OCD compulsion/intrusive thought, for example I‚Äôd get a random thought one day that I‚Äôd stop caring about consequences and unknowingly hurt myself or my family, but these obsessions would normally last about a day or 2 and then disappear.

I‚Äôve been in a cycle for the last 5-6 months of worrying about various mental illnesses that I don‚Äôt have, mainly being schizophrenia or any form of psychosis, and thankfully that particular psychosis anxiety seems to be dying down. 

Unfortunately though, I‚Äôm now starting to really obsess over depression and suicide. In fundamentally afraid of dying, which is one of the main reasons as to why I have health anxiety, because if a heart attack didn‚Äôt imply death, then I would never worry about it again, in the same way that if a cold could imply death, then I‚Äôd be terrified of it.

So it‚Äôs confusing that I‚Äôm obsessed over suicide. My problem is that I have a family history of depression, with at least one person in every previous generation having it to some degree, so that is really adding to me fears at the moment.

Im just terrified that I am already, or am going to become depressed and eventually kill myself. I‚Äôll often have intrusive thoughts about suicide where my brain will automatically say ‚Äúmaybe I should just be dead‚Äù and then 2 seconds later I‚Äôll start saying to myself ‚Äúno no no I don‚Äôt want to die, I don‚Äôt want to commit suicide, I don‚Äôt want to die‚Äù

Now for some reason I'm starting to worry that I might have sent him something illegal (child porn), which literally makes no sense because I have no attraction to kids and find that stuff disgusting and vile. I know for a fact I've never ever tried to look for child porn, but then I start thinking that maybe one day I stumbled upon it by accident and did a stupid thing by sending him some pics as a joke. I'm 99% sure this never happened. I'm pretty sure if I saw some fucked up shit like that I would remember it, but I have no recollection of anything of the sort. 

I've been trying to reassure myself this never happened, but I no longer have any of the emails from back then so I can't be sure. I'm honestly doubting my maturity from back then too, because I would think I wouldn't be that stupid to do something like that when I was 19-20. 

I don't know how to get past obsessing over this. Over the last few days it has gotten so bad that I'm convinced the feds will show up at my door at any point and my life will be over. I wish I still had my emails from back then just so I could confirm my beliefs, but without them I'm just left in a constant state of ""what if"".",OCD,1574298728,nop_AD,4,1,True,2019-11-20

"Wow, I think my whole life makes sense now??","This is the third time I'm writing this post because I keep fucking up so I will try to be concise.

I was diagnosed with OCD years ago when I was 14 and seeing a psychiatrist because of sexual assault related trauma/depression. That made sense in that moment but then when I did better I didn't believe anymore that I had it because I didn't HAVE to do a lot of routine stuff anymore. And then that kind of went up and down with another depression and another period during which I was doing great. And then now I am starting to feel pretty bad again because of reasons that just keep reappearing in my life and I honestly just stumbled upon this thread accidentally but I saw so many post and so many memes that just seemed to sum up everything that goes wrong in my head. I guess I never replay made an effort to actually look into what OCD was and it wasn't really explained to me much by said psychiatrist except for the having to do routine stuff. But there's so many things that are mentioned here that I had never even linked to possibly being OCD things and now I'm like wow what.

Some problems that keep on coming back into my life with varying severity:
- I'm really perfectionistisch. I always feel like everything I do has to be productive and I feel really awful when it doesn't work out, but then I'm also pretty easily distracted so it often does actually not work out and then I feel bad about myself and then I think about everything I dislike about myself and then I get more and more caught up in that which obviously makes me less able to concentrate etc.
- I literally can't concentrate in class unless I fold paper stars (if which I have at least 30 peanut butter jars full (thousands if not ten thousands of these things) which I have collected over the years and can't throw out) or drawing these black and white line art things where the lines have to be perfect with no little white kissing parts or non-smooth blotches/sides etc.
- I have felt really impaired creatively even though I used to be a creative child, because at some point making anything became about the result and not the process. And the result had to be perfect and I couldn't even start anything knowing in advance that it wouldn't be perfect, so my hands would start shaking or I'd start crying trying to play the piano and I didn't even fucking draw for years.
- social interaction can be so difficult because I'm constantly occupied with like ""am I being normal?"" ""is this how people interact?"" ""what if I'm doing it wrong"" ""wow Im acting super nervous people most think I'm so weird""
- when people say things I find very important and disagree with I just can. Not. Stay. Quiet. I'm literally losing friends now because ""I have to make everything political"", but I study anthropology and I'm learning all this shit about the injustices of the world and if you're going to make jokes about the environment or sexism or anything serious I just can not let it go mentally because it feels like you are the problem and I have to solve it
- it feels like I have to solve the whole world and therefore I. Have. To. Be. Perfect. At. Uni. But I handed in my last paper a week late because I wanted to include everything as everything is related to everything and I just couldn't let go of any of the things.
- when I'm sad or angry I go on these huge rants and I can't stop even though I know I will regret it after and I just keep thinking and thinking about it which is why I have to get it the fuck out of me and then afterwards I feel so stupid and like this person I ranted to will fucking dislike me like shit and then I have to tell them about that to fix that and then that becomes a whole new loop
- I quite often have this thing where I have to go through all options or possibilities of something without being able to pick something if I don't know everything that's there. And then that extends to for example writing papers, where for example if I have a certain selection of papers I want to base my paper on, I have to read all of them from A to Z, but then I don't have time to do that, but I still don't feel like I can start writing when I haven't done it. And then I have so little time left that eventually I have to rush everything out last minute while still feeling like I don't know everything I need to know and as such hand in bad papers. I'm currently trying to write my thesis, but because it's my thesis I feel like I have to know everything which means that I essentially haven't done anything yet and my supervisor is really on my back about it and that really really stresses me out. 
- so many intrusive thoughts
- I self diagnosed myself with basically everything from bipolar disorder to adhd but looking at this thread I'm just like???? This could be explained by something I actually was diagnosed with all along?

I could think of way way way more examples but I already said this would be concise, which it really isn't, but just.. Does this make sense???

"Lost, don't know where to start or how to seek help","Hi. 

I don't know how to begin this post, other than to tell you all that I'm so physically and mentally exhausted from what I think is OCD. 

I grew up in a cult. Where everything we did was highly regulated and we were taught that god could read our thoughts and could punish us for ""thought crime"". As a child, this was highly disturbing to me, and I remember the first intrusive thoughts I had were of me being unable to stop thinking of christmas music (Christmas was not allowed and anyone caught celebrating it would be shunned). I was maybe 6 years old. From then, it evolved into me being scared to communicate with the devil through my thoughts, then it became me being scared of causing my parent's death if I didn't skip every sixth square on the tile, and slowly evolved into many more things like fear of being gay, and fear of other things that I can't bring myself to say because it still scares me so fucking much. This, along with a compulsive need to wash my hands that phases in and out of my life. I'm in my twenties now, and my intrusive thoughts are ruining me. I don't know if it's OCD, I've never been formally diagnosed, but I'm almost positive it is. The day I discovered what OCD was, I cried out of fucking relief that I wasn't the only person who could think such awful things. 

I tried going to the doctor once, because my insurance requires for me to have a referral from a general health physician in order to see a psychiatrist. It took everything in me to go and tell them what was going on. They put me on anti-depressants and didn't refer me to a psychiatrist. For a while, the meds helped, but I ran out, and I'm so scared to go back and bare my whole heart and soul to them again only for me to end up here again. 

I want help, so bad, but i'm scared and I don't know where to start. I'm terrified that people will think my thoughts are things that I actually want to do, and that they'll misinterpret me. There were other things that happened while I was in the cult, and I think i'm dealing with a lot of trauma from that and that has left me in a very fragile mental state, if anyone were to misinterpret my intrusive thoughts as desires, I don't think I could handle that. It would destroy me. I just know that I need to do something because it has gotten to the point where I can't have sex with my boyfriend (I used to love sex!!!)  without being triggered and ending up with an anxiety attack. I want so bad to get married one day and have a happy family, but i don't know if I could handle being married with someone I love, or having kids! I want my life back, I don't want my stupid brain to call the shots anymore.

Anyways, I'm so sorry for venting and I apologize if this isn't what the sub was intended for. If the mods feel the need to delete this it's okay, at least i got it off my chest. If you read all of this incoherent rambling, thank you.",OCD,1574308292,dogfoodjingles,2,1,True,2019-11-20

Approaching family member about OCD,"Hello,

Recently, I‚Äôve noticed that a close family member‚Äôs OCD has been getting more and more severe. This is an older family member and I come from a family where mental illness isn‚Äôt really understood or talked about. I want to approach this family member and explain what this is and how they can get help, and how I‚Äôm here to support them. However, I don‚Äôt even think they know they have it. I don‚Äôt want to hurt their feelings or make them feel like something is wrong. I certainly do not want to come off disrespectful. I just want them to know that there is help and they don‚Äôt have to deal with it alone. I know they realize what they do is interfering with their daily life but I don‚Äôt think they know what this is specifically called or that there are resources to help them through it.  

So my question is: how do I approach this discussion in the most empathetic and supporting matter?

For people that have OCD (I‚Äôm so sorry if this sentence is worded wrong) how would you want your family members to help/support you?

My OCD makes it impossible to tell what I feel/believe and what is just doubt,"Hi all, this is gonna be a long one. No TL;DR, sorry.

As far as I or any of my MHP can tell I have Pure O-OCD, my OCD has in the past migrated to other areas that involved some physical compulsions(mostly just avoidance, which I still have to a much lesser degree if you consider that a physical compulsion) but for now and sometime it has been mental compulsions. My main compulsions are debating in my head(over and over to occasionally find resolution only to lose it again), searching for evidence, reviewing events in the past, reviewing/searching my feelings/bodily sensations, ruminating etc. Like pretty much the rest of you, because OCD kind of rests entirely on this, I have problems with doubt. Only difference perhaps is that doubting is my obsession, full stop. Maybe you could say it's really needing to know the truth 100% or make sure things are right(in both senses of the word) but its basically the same. It started Jan 2017 when I was watching some discussion on YouTube when someone I agreed with/respected defended someone else whom I find very disagreeable and it just triggered this feeling of complete and utter ""doubt"" in my mind. I felt this feeling go through my head/brain, it was a while ago(feels almost like another life) but it was like some kind of creeping feeling or something and ever since then I've felt almost permanently different in my body/mind. I think I feel tense all the time but I don't remember if I felt differently before(state dependent memory) or what good or even ""normal"" feels like and I get tension headaches often. Pathological doubt is the term I've seen and I think it's accurate to me, everything I thought to be true, right, normal, accurate etc. came into question. It could be just a general feeling of doubt/disillusionment but more often it was just like a gun going off in my mind every time I saw something, like BANG there is that feeling of doubt. That whatever it is might not true, it might be a lie, they may be disingenuous, I'm missing something. Then there is the classic part of OCD, ""I'm a bad person"". For me it was ""I'm a bad person for being x"" or a bad person for having particular political/social/morals beliefs or having a particular reaction or lack thereof to certain things. ""I'm a bad/potentially violent person for liking violent media"", something which would get worse when I began to have Harm OCD but would happen later. I would over intellectualize/place too much value into stuff and read things into it, which still takes the joy from almost any enjoyable activity. I became obsessed with figuring out my political beliefs and make sure they made sense and were coherent, without any potential contradictions or flaws. Anything I believed or anything I enjoyed had to fit into it or I would try to fit it into it, to no avail. Life lost most its joy, all I had was pain, confusion and distress. Which is weird because seemingly 90+ percent of people with OCD(real scientific, fact based number here) suffer from anxiety or anxiety related distress as a result of obsessions. As my OCD has shifted slightly over time I have experienced full blown panic attacks due to OCD but that isn't what was debilitating then or now. From seemingly that moment when the doubt started I had depression but the biggest problem was the very real, almost physical(though it's difficult to differentiate physical vs mental when it comes to the brain/mind) what I call ""physic pain"" that I'd experience. It would hurt, sometimes I would get anxiety symptoms as I mentioned like extreme tension, headaches etc. but for the most part it just felt like this mental pain or even anguish in my mind itself whenever the doubt would pop in and a feeling I still have trouble describing and has only gotten worse. It's kind of feeling a bit like being in freefall, though I've been in freefall and it doesn't quite match up. It's just like everything feels out of wack or lost and you can never feel calm or at ease, though a big part of pathological doubt for me is even doubting/questioning my emotions so I had trouble remembering what thats really like. When I cry or feel/have the urge to cry my OCD makes me question it(for no real reason at all) or says that crying makes me weak. As we all know OCD(and other mental health disorders) is insidious like that. I can't feel angry and vent out my anger(not on people of course) because it means I'm crazy or an ""angry white male""(a term I used to not care about one way or the other). Related to that I feel unable to find relief in almost anything, I always have that feeling that I mentioned. I don't ""trust"" any of the feelings I have or I'm worried that certain feelings triggered be certain things might make something happen like it did two years ago. 

My brain always seems to be in the ""metacognitive state"" as my Psychologist called it. I doubt my own motives in things, I say ""you only want to think that"", ""you're deluding yourself"" etc. I think about thinking, I analyze my feelings, I'm unable to be truly ""present"" and enjoy things without over analyzing as I side. Even after my OCD began to kick in this wasn't the case but like many/most of you I have black and white thinking. For example, if a video game I play has some sort of theme, message etc(or I interpret that it does) I find disagreeable it means I can't enjoy it. It's like some kind of emotional contamination or even perfectionism, it has to been 100% in line with my values or whatever it might be. If not is spoils the whole experience and often times I will constantly argue/ruminate about whatever it is over and over again trying to resolve it and convince myself why I should enjoy something.

Often times however my OCD seems indescribable or incomprehensible to even me. It seems like much of it takes place beneath the surface or it remains in the realm of feelings, imagination or vague visual images. I feel something but I can't really describe it but on some level I know what it relates to or where its coming from. I have no real idea how to properly articulate it or combat it though. Thoughts/concerns about race/race related stuff was and still to some degree is part of my OCD and I remember one time two white girls crossed the street in front of my car and some uncomfortable/disconcerting/distressing feeling popped into my head, as far as I can recall there was no clear mental image associated with it. As I told my therapist later when she asked about an example of what I was experiencing at the time, ""I don't know what the thought/potential concern was but I know somehow, someway it had to do with black men"". Whether it was some racial/psychosexual thing or being concerned that for some reason black men in particular might harm or abuse them I still have no idea. I just know that feeling when I saw those two white girls cross the street in front of my to do with men who happen to be black in particular. I've read about the associations OCD makes in your mind between certain things but I'm not sure if that's quite it.

As the title of this post says one of the most distressing, hellish parts of my OCD is not knowing what I actually think, feel, believe and what is just OCD making me be a Doubting Thomas(my name coincidentally) about everything. Despite what I said about my OCD doubting everything there's seems to have been a few things it left alone until the past six months or so. I now have questions about my sexuality, gender and political beliefs. I'm a straight male but I have trouble finding women attractive due to my OCD making me doubt things and removing the blurred lines that use to exist, for ex. why I find a women's butt attractive but not a man even though minus the body hair they are identical. I find or at least is seems a lot of my feelings and beliefs about things have done a 180. It's very distressing, not to be too dramatic but it's kind of like becoming ""the very thing you swore to destroy"" (Obi-Wan anyone?). Not that I ever wanted to destroy anyone I disagreed with, its just the best analogy I can think of. It must be what I imagine losing faith is like. Though it's strange because for the most part it seems the other side, these new thoughts, feelings, beliefs don't get questioned or don't get attacked by pathological doubt as much. Though it's likely because because OCD enjoys destroying what used to be and lets all the new, usually negative things exist without question(like why someone with Harm OCD's brain will say they are  definitely a serial killer/psychopath). I often question though that these might be my new beliefs no matter how much I may not want them to be, I can't help how I feel. Feelings ultimately are what inform what we think is right, true, correct, accurate etc. I've done intense CBT/ERP to little avail(helped my Harm OCD but little else) and they constantly say ""thoughts and feelings don't accurately represent who/what you are, your values, beliefs etc."" but ultimately what else do I have to go on? Actions yes but that only determines if I am not a murderer/rapist/psychopath as of yet, as an example(I'm not currently concerned about those things to be clear). Like I said when it comes to determining what you believe is true/right/accurate all you have is your feelings and mine are all out of whack. I don't know what is ""authentic"" and what is caused by OCD, or if there is really a difference. It seems the fundamental core of my OCD is extreme self loathing, self critique and not trusting/valuing myself, whether it be that I'm not a bad person or that my ideas/beliefs/feelings are true, valid and have intrinsic merit. 

Relief is what I crave the most, I have frequent but non-serious(i.e. no plans/intent on acting them) thoughts about death or suicidal ideation. The idea of death can bring me comfort, as something free from the troubles of my mind and the world. As an escape. Though more often now I become obsessed/concerned that even death won't be an escape and I will still obsess or be distressed by my thoughts/obsessions in whatever afterlife exists. It will only be exchanging one painful plane of existence for another. It's painful having everything seemingly taken from you, the things you enjoy, the things that gave you comfort or certainty, the things you valued. And theres nothing you can do to turn it back or convince yourself of the things that you think or historically have make you happy. During my time in CBT/ERP as part of treatment they recommend practicing ""letting go of everything you fear or accepting what you fear being potentially true"", for example with with problems with Harm OCD accepting you may kill someone but ultimately it ""doesn't matter"" or ""letting go of everything you fear to lose""(another Star Wars reference anybody?). Not that murdering is ok with them but not catastrophizing or if your fear is realistic or isn't something that can be blown out of proportion(like murder) but that the world will not end if the feared outcome comes true, if I properly understood them. For the same reason I always disliked the philosophy/spirit behind that Star Wars quote, I think that whole Zen, ""nothing really matters"" is actually kind of nihilistic in some way. Like if I don't ever want to let go of the person I used to be, the things I used to enjoy etc. Or to use the Star Wars example(I love the prequels obviously) Anakin's visions of his wife dying in childbirth, he's just supposed to except it as part of life(or the will of the force or whatever). I mean that was seriously like the worse answer you could give to someone who was already discontent with the Jedi. Anyway.

I don't entirely know what I set out with when writing this except maybe to put my thoughts and concerns into writing, though this ended up being half the length of one of my Grad school papers. I've of course discussed all of this with my Therapist/Psychologist/Psychiatrist but never where I've had time to go through everything in such a semi-coherent matter. I'll probably give this to my Therapist/Psychiatrist to read to help them better understand actually.

I have intrusive thoughts that I steal things,"Hi, this is my first time posting here. I would like to get this off my chest.

Why dismiss psychoanalysis right away?,"I have seen many stories on this subreddit, that are sad and many remind me of my own problems. But what I thought, reading these disturbing stories is that I find it hard to believe that intrusive thoughts and obsessions are *completely* random (I mean, topics they resolve around). This, in turn, lead me to seek some clues as to what these obsessions *mean*, where do they stem from etc. I have seen psychoanalysis being mostly dismissed right away in this subreddit and that does not surprise me, since the current, so to say, paradigm in psychology is that we, humans, are simply the sum total of  processes taking place in our brain (I obviously simplify here).

I am not a huge fan of psychoanalysis, but I am definitely interested in the work of Freud and Lacan (through ≈Ωi≈æek) and one thing I like in psychoanalysis is that there is a belief that we can explain and analyse human behaviour, find the meaning of delusions and obsessions. Today we see a prevailing attitude that this goal is pointless. Thus medication and training people like rats or pigeons to do what is deemed 'good' for them (in the eyes of society) is seen as the only way forward for individuals.

But when I read those stories and when I think of my own severe OCD, my intrusive thoughts and so on, I think a careful and critical analysis of these phenomena is essential and I cannot believe they are meaningless. I mean, some people, including me, first obsess over X, then -- over Y and sometimes X and Y are barely related and I think there must be an explanation as to why this thing triggers one person and not the other thing. People obsessed with the idea that they are paedophiles or homosexuals or over the idea that their boyfriend/girlfriend is cheating is not something totally *meaningless*. We cannot analyse these things, pretending that these particular phenomena are random, since they are heavily charged with meaning. 

By the way, I would like to go one step forward and propose we look into the subject of how obsessions and intrusive thought are *historically* contingent. Here I remember Deleuze and Guattari and the socioanalysis, proposed by sociologist Pierre Bourdieu: indeed, today people obsess more about certain things that hardly were that dangerous a few decades ago, and back then people obsessed over things that are mostly foreign to us. Once again, to believe the topics of our obsessions and intrusive thoughts are transhistorical (atemporary), seems ridiculous to to.

Just so exhausted/ rant,"I‚Äôve spent the last idk 4 hours constantly checking a photo and getting upset every time that my hair doesn‚Äôt look right.  It‚Äôs so dumb! All it is, is that I pinned the front strands of my hair back. I do this all the time. But for some reason, tonight, I‚Äôm afraid it looks un feminine and gross (not that those two things are related in the real world, it‚Äôs just how my checking behavior for appearances and sexual purity thoughts combine into one big ocd mess sometimes).  It‚Äôs flat at the top and poofy at the sides and I‚Äôm afraid I look terrible and yucky and too masculine (I‚Äôm a woman). Objectively, I know the photo i posted is really cute. I can‚Äôt take it down because I just got a little in my sorority, and this was the big reveal and we got all dressed up and cute and it‚Äôs very sentimental. But I cannot stop thinking about how masculine I must look with my partially pinned back hair (even though I was in a pink shirt and pink boa üòÇ). I also objectively know that people understand that the hair is partially pinned back and hair naturally doesn‚Äôt fall like that, but I still feel like a freak and I want to cry.

Yesterday I spent hours checking to see if my nostrils were uneven. Sometimes it‚Äôs my right canine tooth. Sometimes it‚Äôs my eyelashes. Sometimes it‚Äôs the fear that I look ugly and gross and too masculine/ gay (I recognize that this is very stereotypical and potentially hurtful, but it‚Äôs really only directed at myself and has to do with a lot of childhood issues) even though I‚Äôm 5 foot, straight, and objectively pretty feminine.During the summer it‚Äôs about bugs crawling in my orifices. I can‚Äôt swim in the water without thinking about the harmless moon jellies getting in my orifices. Sometimes I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôve caused myself medical harm and I freak out till it‚Äôs explain why it‚Äôs not possible.  When I was 10 it was leaving my headband (that I wore like a safety blanket) by my nightstand and touching it till it felt ok to let it go and go to sleep.

It‚Äôs just so exhausting. I‚Äôve lived most of my life with OCD and was never officially diagnosed (doctors get weird when you‚Äôre already diagnosed with one disorder) because I was already diagnosed with social anxiety disorder. But my therapist is less into labels and is trying to treat alllll the issues. Medication is helping less and less. And my physical health has gotten worse too (chronic migraines and narcolepsy). Sometimes I beat myself up so much, but I try to remind myself that Ive got a lot going on. I just want to live a normal life and have time for friends and parties and my boyfriend again, and get to take a regular college course load, but I feel like I‚Äôm prisoner to these three diseases just taking turns hitting me every time I get back up and fucking with my sleep patterns and sense of self worth.",OCD,1574339444,girlygirldoglvr,1,1,True,2019-11-21
What kind of meltdown is this?,"Hi everyone. My name's Sofia, I'm 23. I was recently diagnosed with OCD and I'm taking anti-depressants and anti-psychotic drugs now (doing so much better), but for all my life I had serious mental problems. Luckily, I can often hide them from others and most people I know think I'm ""normal"". I have a boyfriend, I work as trainee lawyer, I have friends... Etc.

This might sound silly, but... I have a question regarding my mental meltdowns, what they are specifically and if anyone else has the same problem.

Since I was 12 I have a symptom that I find really weird. When I get overwhelmed by some situation, usually a serious argument with certain people when I'm not feeling well, sometimes, I start feeling like there's a fire growing inside of me. It's the worst feeling in world and I don't even know what to call it. I start giving signs like crying in a weird way, shaking, saying bad things to myself, repeating some movements. At some point, if the trigger is still present, I meltdown. I completely lose control of my behavior and there's literally nothing I can do to control myself. I feel overwhelmed and out of myself and full of negative thoughts and sensations, it's not anxiety, it's not fear, it's not sadness or anger. It's something MUCH worse.

I start screaming and I sit on the floor doing repeated movements and usually I scratch myself or hit myself. Literally the only times where I hurt myself were like this, never premeditated, always when I can't control what I'm doing.

When I'm feeling like this, if I'm not alone, I need people to just stop talking and give me space. Otherwise, it can get even worse.

Does anyone experience this? Does anyone know what this is? Because for some time I thought it was like a panic attack, but I don't feel like I can't breath or like I'm dying. I think it's a bit different. And now I'm watching this show called ""Atypical"" about a boy who has autism and the breakdowns he has kinda look like mine, but I don't think I'm autistic lol.

Female suffering from Retroactive Jealousy,"So, when I was 20 I had my first boyfriend. He and two friends of mine had a band, all of their songs where about my ex's past flames, past crushes or past girlfriends. He also had crushes on friends of mine. So I knew exactly how he felt when he was with these girls and I knew everything they did together. Also, he would tell me a lot of details because we were friends when he was going out with these girls. I suffered from a lot of retroactive jealousy in this relationship that lasted for 2 years. It was horrible, I felt like shit everyday. The exes where very present, they sometimes texted him or called him even tho he told me they hadn't spoken for years. (maybe I just think they were present because i was always bringing them up but whatever). 

I broke up with him and everything got better, I was able to be myself again. 

Now I'm 26, started a new relationship and it's been the best thing I ever had. Now it's been 1 year and I began to feel these things again. I thought I only felt them in my first relationship because my ex was way more experienced than me. And also because he kept telling me his exes weren't present in his life but they acted in a different way. (I actually met two of them...) But anyway no... I came to notice that it wasn't his problem, it was mine. Recently I started to search about this issue and I discovered RJ. 

I've been reading a lot and one thing that really helps me is when I want to know something I just don't go dig. I just don't ask my boyfriend and I already told him that I don't wanna know anything, and he seems ok with it, he also doesn't ask me about my past bf. Of course I get weak sometimes and discovered things that I wish I didn't, I obsessed over it but never asked him about it, never asked for reassurance because - from past experience -  I know there's nothing he can say to make it better...it only gets worse. Instead, I started to think about his past in a positive way:  it's good that he has had good experiences and if it wasn't for her he wouldn't be with me. We also still have a lot of good memories to create together. 

**The point of writing this post is that I feel like I'm starting to get control over this thing, but when I realised I had RJ going on, I got myself an appointment with a therapist that I was supposed to see in a few days, but now I feel like I should cancel and not waste the money? What do you guys think? I'm scared I will go down again and lose control for some little thing and I really don't want to spoil what I have, it's been a very happy year.

Impulses vs thoughts,"Hi, I‚Äôd like to know if there‚Äôs a difference between impulses and thoughts. I‚Äôd like to tell you what I believe is an impulse and I‚Äôd like someone to please tell me if I‚Äôm right about it. Also there‚Äôs an experience that just happened to me and I‚Äôd like to know if what happened to me fits to an impulse or if it doesn‚Äôt.

Here‚Äôs the story, sorry for the length:

It‚Äôs important to know that I identify myself as gay. I don‚Äôt find women sexually attractive, although I can tell when I find any of them beautiful or physically attractive. That being said, yesterday I had party with some school friends. Ages between 22-25. 
What happened is that I was drinking quite a bit, I had 3 shots of vodka, and also had more than a couple of beers, in less than 2 hours. And for me, that amount of alcohol is not something I usually drink and so I ended up being not completely drunk, it was more somewhere in between being tipsy and drunk (more towards the drunk side), and I can remember everything.
It‚Äôs also important to note that I have a boyfriend and that he is part this school class and so he also attended to the party.
After I had those drinks, euphoria hit me and so I felt happy and less aware of things I usually worry about, and da*n I worry. 

My OCD focuses specially in my relationship and everything surrounding it. That being said my boyfriend and I didn‚Äôt have exactly a great day before the party, it wasn‚Äôt totally bad but it surely wasn‚Äôt a good one either. And when it comes to drinking I always get anxious that he might betray me while being drunk, because he tends to forget what he does when he gets drunk.

And so back to the story, there was this girl that I like as a friend, I believe she‚Äôs smart, beautiful and easygoing and we get along pretty well, but still I have never seen her attractive in a sexual way nor have I ever wanted or tried to approach her in any compromising way (never tried to kiss her or flirt with her or anything), up until now... I guess? See, that‚Äôs the point of all this, I don‚Äôt know if what I felt was an impulse or an urge or an intrusive thought OR if I really found her sexually attractive OR if I really wanted to do what I‚Äôm about to tell you. 

What happened is that we where talking pretty close to each other and suddenly I felt the urge to kiss her! And I immediately felt awful about it. ‚ÄòWas I about to do it?‚Äô ‚ÄòWhy I felt the urge to approach her in that way?‚Äô ‚ÄòWas I very close to her?‚Äô ‚ÄòWas I doing anything to try to facilitate the kiss?‚Äô ‚ÄòWHY I FELT LIKE WANTING TO DO IT? MAYBE I WANT TO DO IT‚Äô.‚Äù

She even has a boyfriend and da*n I wouldn‚Äôt ever want to interfere in any relationship.

And that‚Äôs what happened, but this kind of urges (if I can call them that way), have happened to me before and also (but not always) while being drunk and with different random people.

#Are impulses something that you feel like you want to do in the moment? 
#Are urges and impulses the same?
#Are intrusive thoughts also the same? 
I‚Äôd like to know if there‚Äôs a difference to have more tools defend myself from OCD.

PS. Important to note:

#1. I‚Äôm always trying to be good in my relationship. I always take care of it and I try to avoid any situation that might endanger it. And so, I‚Äôm always anxious when situations that put it at risk arise.

#2. At the party and right before the moment of the urge I wasn‚Äôt feeling anxious, I was indeed happy and relaxed by the effects of the alcohol.

#3. My boyfriend was near my friend and I when I felt the urge, even her boyfriend was near, we where never apart from the group. 

4. There was this other girl at the party who was truly drunk and she was being too affectionate and by that I mean she was kissing everyone in the cheeks, but you could tell that if someone turned its head around to her just a bit, she might start to make out with that person. She even kissed one of my cheeks and I immediately turned away from her and never felt any urge.",OCD,1574351290,4ndyPower,1,1,True,2019-11-21

Yes, I know that those men who commit actual violent crime are in a minority, but how would any woman (or I myself, for that matter) know if I belong into that group or not?

Could i have OCD?,"Hello,
Long story short (if you want the long version please read my post in r/Anxiety) after being afraid for some time of developing a mental illness like phsycosis or schizophrenia, and overthinking every sound to make sure it wasnt an hallucination, a week ago i had a mini panic attack some minutes after searching for symptoms of schizophrenia (worst idea ever), and i was convinced 100% that i was losing my mind. After that i started having this intrusive thoughts about things that ive read schizophrenic people believe, like ""what if im god?"" and being freaked out every time by those thoughts.
For example, i read that one common delusional thought is that someone is following you, so i started to think that someone was following me as an intrusive thought, but the thought of thinking that (if that makes sense, i hope it does) made me panic. Ive had these intrusive thoughts about lots of things in these past days, like for example i turn on the TV and think ""what if i feel like the TV is thinking about me?"" (another common delusion suffered by those with schizophrenia) and then i subconsciously start to find a way to link everything thats said on TV to me, and i get freaked out about it. 

My first reaction was that i was absolutely going crazy but now ive discovered OCD, and ive read about some people who've had experiences similar to mine and it really sounds like this thought process might be OCD.",OCD,1574366172,Capi9800,4,1,True,2019-11-21

What I have been doing now...,"Most of my intrusive thought are around guilt. Like being attracted to the wrong person and feeling guilt and shame. So every time an intrusive thought comes to me, and it‚Äôs usually sexual. I ask myself ‚Äúis it actually about this person?‚Äù 
‚ÄúIs the person causing this‚Äù 
‚ÄúIs this related to this person in anyway?‚Äù 

The answer is always NO.

Then I say oh it‚Äôs just my ocd putting on a face and a way to bother me. So, I tell my ocd, I understand you, I accept you, I love you. And then proceed to go back to what I was doing.

Bonjour Reddit! Any advice on CBT packs for real event ocd?,"I find a lot about regular themes but not this theme .

I've tried ERP before but something about my autistic brain makes me have crippling flashbacks and images of the times. So I want to try CBT- any workbooks/ resources? I've tried stresspac (that wasn't really the most helpful) and mind over mood- great book but again didn't seem to alleviate much of it.

I don't want to go into therapy, too shy and don't trust people (I'm pretty paranoid (I'm working on it slowly) as I worry about confidentiality). Also I have a distaste to the last therapist I had and don't want to ever go back to that clinic thing again

Obsession with justice,"Hi All,

I've noticed I have a bit of an obsession with/compulsion to check news about the Jeffrey Epstein story.
It's not something that interferes with the quality of my life, but I feel compelled to check for new developments when I wake up, when I go to bed, and throughout the day. It's almost as if, by checking on the news, I feel like I can will something positive to happen to hold evildoers/liars/abusers to account. I know that's not actually the case.

I get really invested in seeing justice done, and seeing the truth come out in situations where I feel the public is being lied to, and/or powerful people who have broken the law are getting away with it. I feel this way about the Jeffrey Epstein conspiracy, implicating Prince Andrew, Bill Clinton, Alan Dershowitz (et al.), I felt this way about Hillary Clinton's private email server, Bernie Sanders getting shafted by the Democrats, Edward Snowden, Julian Assange, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and 9/11. I'm not even an American. But the blatant lies and injustices people in the US are getting away with are highly visible to the world, and REALLY irk me.

I wonder if others have similar experiences. I wonder what you think about this obsession.
Also, know that I'm not a non-OCD person thinking ""that's so OCD"". I am definitely on the OCD/perfectionism spectrum, so I'm interpreting this from that lens.

What do y'all think?
Also, note I didn't say anything about Trump and Russia, because I think that's a crock of shit.
Even though Trump is a ridiculous, narcissistic asshole, I don't believe he stole the election. I just think a lot of people couldn't stomach voting for someone who so obviously and publicly broke the law.

This could easily turn into a political debate, but I'm not super interested in that. More so the obsession with justice.",OCD,1574383434,macadocious,6,1,True,2019-11-21

Is any of this relatable to you? (Potentially triggering),"So, I‚Äôm an anxious/depressed person. I am not looking for a diagnosis but only seeking to understand if I‚Äôm alone in these behaviors.

I rented a house with a few friends and found my doorknob had no lock. I felt very uncomfortable for those 2 days it was being shipped, and once I installed it I make sure it‚Äôs locked 100% of the time when I‚Äôm gone and while I sleep. (Often while I‚Äôm just awake hanging out in my room too). Whenever I leave the house (rarely outside of work as it‚Äôs much easier to avoid all my anxiety triggers if I stay inside) I have to check if the door is locked by rattling it repeatedly. I‚Äôll turn the knob like 5-10 times (not a specific number each time) and then walk away to leave. As soon as I step a few feet away I have to go back and turn the knob several more times just to be sure, then I step a few feet away again and the loop repeats. If I am really late somewhere and I force myself to quickly leave the loop then I‚Äôm stuck with intrusive thoughts all day about what could be happening in my room, usually centered around the friend of a roommate stealing things (which I really don‚Äôt think they would...) or my roommate spilling water on my computer. The second one is a big one for me, I start to feel incredibly uncomfortable whenever anyone is even standing in a certain radius around my computer. Whenever people come in to my room and it seems like they‚Äôre not just popping in and out I start slowly herding them out of the room because inside I‚Äôm screaming and worrying that someone is going to break something or fuck something up (or something....I‚Äôm not really sure why I feel so strongly about it). This behavior goes back to my past living situations as well. 

Another thing is appliances like the fridge, walking away from it and then having the intrusive thoughts, (what if it‚Äôs cracked open? All your food and your roommates food will spoil) or checking the front doors to make sure they actually closed (the heat is escaping the house. the cat might get out. a stranger could walk in). And having to check again and again when I know I just did. 

I also have to double check on things that other people do because compared to my constant hyper vigilance about everything, everyone else seems oblivious and unaware to me. I have serious trust issues because I feel like people without constant anxious thoughts aren‚Äôt doing enough to protect themselves from potential negative consequences.

So yeah, there‚Äôs more I could say but I don‚Äôt want to give you guys a complete wall of text. Again, not asking for a diagnosis but is any of this relatable or familiar sounding?",OCD,1574431945,rhookylu,3,1,True,2019-11-22
Religious OCD,"I have been dealing with OCD for years now, but didnt go and talk to my doctor until a year ago for the first time about it. Over the years it has morphed into various different types, of which religious has been the most long standing one. It reaches deep down to my core of disturbances because my Faith in Christ means the most in this world. It seems like anything I do, watch, read, or basically anything ocd latches onto and tries to but some sort of biblical attachment to it with nonstop blasphemous thoughts. It is crazy and mind boggling how real ocd thoughts feel, and how much they try to convince you that you believe it. I'm still standing strong and now allowing it to get to me as much as before. I have been trying to keep myself from ruminating and doing mental and physical compulsion. Lately I feel as if the emotion has went away to the thoughts which makes me feel like crap, which I understand checking emotion can become a compulsion. I have started back studying my bible I am refusing to avoid things I love anymore because of potential intrusive thoughts. They are just that thoughts, it does not mean I agree with them or that I will begin to believe them. This verse has been my favorite as I go through this battle even though I have received such wonderful revelations from God. So to keep me from becoming proud, I was given a thorn in my flesh, a messenger from Satan to torment me and keep me from becoming proud. Three different times I begged the Lord to take it away. Each time he said, ‚ÄúMy grace is all you need. My power works best in weakness.‚Äù So now I am glad to boast about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ can work through me. That‚Äôs why I take pleasure in my weaknesses, and in the insults, hardships, persecutions, and troubles that I suffer for Christ. For when I am weak, then I am strong.

pOCD or actual pedophilia? please help me :(,"please read the whole thing, literally any reply to this will be great help to me, I just want to know If I‚Äôm a complete monster. 

some background: I‚Äôm 15/F, this Is the only kind of OCD I‚Äôve had to date, and It‚Äôs fairly new. 

so, ever since I‚Äôve developed a sexual desire really, I‚Äôve always been aroused by things that we‚Äôre considered taboo (some examples are rape fantasies, incest, etc.) and some more things. the extreme factor of them is what really gets me off, however I wouldn‚Äôt actually do majority of these things irl (for example I wouldn‚Äôt be in an incest relationship). 

with that being said, now on to the pOCD: I definitely have pOCD because I have all of the symptoms for it: compulsions, intrusive thoughts, intense anxiety, feelings of false (or real?) attraction towards young girls. 

basically what I am wondering here is if you can have pOCD and actually just be a pedophile at the same time, because I know that pOCD‚Äôs job is basically to convince you that you are attracted to children but honestly It feels so incredibly real and I‚Äôm not sure if It‚Äôs just pOCD anymore. I hope I‚Äôm wrong.

now, back to the taboo thoughts: I‚Äôm just going to be completely transparent here even though this is really hard to write. the reason why I‚Äôm thinking it might not just be pOCD is because before all of this even started, occasionally while I was masturbating I would think about men having sex with little girls. not often, maybe a couple of times. and I would get off to these thoughts. I was pretty sure that It was just the taboo-ness of these thoughts that would get me off; and I would NEVER think of MYSELF actually doing sexual acts with children. I think that the thought of such an evil person doing an act that was so widely despised, in secret, is what aroused me. 

for some reason I never thought anything weird of these thoughts until about a month ago, which is when the pOCD started.

I just wanna clarify: I have never been sexually attracted to an actual child in my real everyday life, I‚Äôve never had a crush on a child, I‚Äôve never had an issue interacting with children before, and I‚Äôve never had the urge to do anything sexual to a child. the thought that I was a pedophile never even occurred to be before this pOCD thing started. 

now, my pOCD is convincing me that I‚Äôm just a pedophile for real and It‚Äôs literally killing me. I feel like I deserve to die. 

I have a boyfriend and I told him about these thoughts and my pOCD and everything, and he was fine with it thank god, but if Im an actual pedophile then I gotta break up with him because he doesn‚Äôt deserve someone like me. 

I do plan to see a therapist about this. 

so, are those thoughts that I sometimes have while masturbating just a part of some fucked-up kink or am I actually a pedophile? I really do love kids and I wanna have a daughter of my own In the future but all of this is just ruining me. I have very strong morals and this goes against everything. I would never hurt a child. I feel like the worst person on earth. 

any response is very appreciated. :)",OCD,1574438153,__purity,38,1,True,2019-11-22
Hi! I‚Äôm new :) And have some questions!,"Hello everyone! This is my first post on here. I was hoping to get some insight on OCD. I haven‚Äôt been formally diagnosed, bit am pretty sure I have it and have had it since I was a child. I also have panic disorder.

Tendencies: 

Childhood: I had panic attacks all the time. I was convinced my whole family was going to die all the time. I was convinced I would die of carbon dioxide poisoning, thus I would open my window every night before bed and if it got really bad I would lay at the other side of my bed and fall asleep (because somehow that made it better?) Then I was afraid if throwing up- I would scout out the trashcans when out in public and plan for if I was going to. I would also wake my mom up every night to come reassure me and lay down with me. When the reassurance stopped working I started scratching my arms and legs until they started bleeding because my anxiety was so bad about getting sick and this action lead to relief. I also yawned incessantly when I didn‚Äôt feel good because that action also somehow made it better? All of these tendencies/thoughts lasted a long time before going away. Some still haven‚Äôt completely resolved. 

High school: I was doing pretty well! It was awesome! I still had anxiety and fear of throwing up, but was able to concentrate better due to my anxiety/stress levels being lower. I did a lot of sports- so that contributed to my increased happiness and decreased anxiety/OCD I think.

Adulthood/Now: I still have a fear of throwing up- but not as severe. I don‚Äôt scout out trash cans anymore. I still scratch/pick my arms when stressed about throwing up or anything else. Not as bad as before though. I still get panic attacks from time to time. The really annoying thing now is that when I am severely stressed (family member dying, being away from my family/bf for long periods of time, ect.) I get intrusive thoughts that will not go away. It‚Äôs driving me nuts. Some examples are doubting my relationship (so stupid!) so that I call my boyfriend all the time- resisting this urge is incredibly hard. Driving my car down the highway and my brain being like ‚Äúyou could crash right now and kill yourself or others‚Äù. Or ‚Äúsee that knife over there- you should stab someone right now‚Äù. I also get intrusive suicidal thought that are scary because I know I want to live but my brain is like ‚Äúno you should kill yourself‚Äù. It‚Äôs all very distressing :( I am usually a really positive upbeat person, but this is making me really depressed and feel like there is no way out. 

As a side note- I am being treated for a different diagnosis right now, but I am pretty sure I convince the Psychiatrist I had what I am taking meds for because My OCD and anxiety rumination got in the way. Also, I know ADHD and OCD together is a big topic, but I am pretty sure I do not have ADHD and that any lack of concentration I have or have had was due to my anxiety and OCD. I actually think I pay way too much attention to everything. 

In short- I think I have OCD and I‚Äôm looking for advice, experiences, and info! Thank you :)",OCD,1574438943,Starfire323,1,1,True,2019-11-22

Tocd or real thoughts?,"I have never in my life had doubts or spent time thinking about my gender until about 4 months ago.  I was on a run, listening to music, and a song came on about women. I am a man and I found the song really catchy and was enjoying my run. A lyric of the song is ‚ÄúI am a badass women‚Äù, I sung along to it, and then all of a sudden the thought ‚Äúwait, am I a women?‚Äù popped into my head. And if I‚Äôm being honest it hasn‚Äôt really left my head sense then. 

Fast forward to today I am obsessed with being 100% certain of my gender. I think back constantly trying to find signs, before this thought randomly came into my head, of times where I had doubts but there are none. I think about it constantly and I can‚Äôt find a way for my brain to stop and relax. I try to imagine my self as a woman and it usually brings me a sense of dread and anxiety. But I once again I can‚Äôt be 100% sure if it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm in denial/scared of the trans process or if it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm literally a man and that‚Äôs my identity, not a woman. I constantly am making statements in my head like ‚Äúyou are a man‚Äù or asking my self ‚Äúwhat if I had to transition?‚Äù I constantly analyze everything I do to see if it‚Äôs girly or masculine. I am obsessed with gender when I never was before. And that I think is where the anxiety comes from. Any person who is cis gender wouldn‚Äôt spend so much of the time thinking about this yet I don‚Äôt feel as if I‚Äôm a woman. But I can‚Äôt stop thinking! Ha it‚Äôs crazy!

Although the amount I think about this has increased as time has gone on. I can‚Äôt tell if that points to OCD thoughts or this being real. I am at a loss of where I should go next and my next steps.

Scrupolosity and High Vata in ayurveda?,"I think I am scrupolous;I think God is mad at me perpetually,even if I didnt do anything wrong,and I also think if I touch certain things or don't;that I will incur His/Her anger and that won't love me anymore.I've had this since I was atleast 13 yrs old.I Talked about it to a psychologist yers back,but I never got a diagnosis of ocd scrupolosity only general ocd.

I also did some research,and it seems high Vata people are both prone to ocd and psychosis AND tend to be the most spiritual of all Dosha types.I also have insomnia and other things(skin quality,Ecto-meso body type  etc) wich are considered symptoms of high Vata.Now I am not trying to peddle ayurveda,and much of it is unproven,but I find that link nevertheless very interesting!

I don't know how to get rid of this,besides lowering vata through diet,exercises and such things.I do take anxiolytic sedative medication,because otherwise I could have a panic attack daily,but it just makes me feel a bit calmer and drowsy but the scrupolous ideas still come to me intrusively!

My OCD is... evolving?,"So for the last year I‚Äôve been going through my first big struggle with OCD. I‚Äôve had my really low points and also my highs. I struggle with a few obsessions along the lines of infidelity, sexuality, and harming children. I‚Äôm pretty okay with handling the first two because neither of them are the end of the world, but the one about kids is the toughest. 

It used to be that I was scared that I was sexualizing them in my head, and I struggled with that until recently. I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that I‚Äôm really not into all that, and that it‚Äôs just me hyper-fixating on how guilty even thinking of those things make me feel. So now instead of being anxious around kids because of sexualizing them, my brain has just become accustomed to freaking out at even the sight of a child. 

I literally hate this, because even seeing a child gives me a pit in my stomach and my response is to get as far away as I can. I literally don‚Äôt know how to get over this. I can feel myself slipping into my old habits of checking my thoughts and wondering if this really makes me what I‚Äôm afraid of being. What can I do?

OCD and important decisions.,"Hi, 

  
Someone also has trouble with important/impactful decisions in life. Like my obsessive thoughts are mostly going about how I will die. Like if do this or that I will get tortured in my life for example. So very cruel. But it's especially hard when I have to make a big decision and i try to think positive with the decision. For example renting an appartement, I can see the appartement and have cruel visions of torture. Then I don't dare to rent it cause I think I will be tortured. So it's super annoying if I would find a nice place and I just can't rent it because of OCD and have to pass on it.  


You could say I can try ERP with it and just rent it even though I might have the thoughts but it's seems like the top of the ladder since it's such an impactful decision on my life and I will have to live there for years eventually...

Am I imagining this?,"I know it's not good to self diagnose, but I can't help but think that I have OCD.

That moment when you need reassurance but know that you need to NOT receive reassurance. (Venting thread.),"I'm exhausted. 

I had a dream last night that centers around a few different obsessions of mine, particularly buckling down on the fear of being happy that something bad happened to someone I care about. Naturally, the internal thoughts spiral into convincing myself that I don't believe it, I don't want that to happen, I know that... (*But what if you do? What if you don't care about that person? What if you think these awful things that you are afraid you think?* the OCD brain says.) Then I feel like I need to tell my s/o, who I've already discussed it with a little bit, so that he can know how terribly my brain is in relation to some things (because I feel guilty when I withhold things because surely, he needs to know what a screwed up person I am inside if he's going to continue to be with me; this is also where I tend to look for reassurance, even though he's usually pretty good about not giving it). 

I'm not handling this particularly well at the moment; going through the usual internal rituals that I know I shouldn't be doing but not knowing whether to try to stop or to keep going because stopping means sitting with the thoughts in my head, and that place really sucks. 

Anyway, I'm not looking for reassurance about the thoughts. I'm just very tired of hanging out with my brain and needed to vent in a place of people who get it. 

OCD sucks. The 'normal' world has no idea how bad OCD sucks. I'm truly thankful that my compulsions are internal because it gives me the freedom to appear unaffected to the world around me, but it makes it difficult to discuss/educate because then I get ""the look,"" the, ""you don't do any of the typical mainstream-known compulsions, so there's no way you have OCD"" look that inevitably comes when your behavior is typical even if you're in inner turmoil about whether or not you want to do something awful or want something awful to happen and can't focus on doing your job for the last half hour of your shift. 

The worst part about everything is not being able to be confident in what you think or feel, imo. Having to constantly convince yourself that the awful things you think aren't your *real* thoughts/feelings. That at your core, you don't want or believe the terrible things your OCD tells you that you do. The guilt of thinking and feeling it all. The fear of who you are as a human being hinging on things that you can't escape. 

It's been a little over ten years since my symptoms to really interfere with my life. Things are so, so much better now than they were then. Back then, I quit my part-time job, left the church (though that decision became non-OCD related later on), stopped working around kids, begged my mom to hide anything sharp in our house, and overall ceased functioning for the better part of a year. Now, most days, even if I'm not symptom-free, I'm genuinely okay. I graduated high school eight and a half years ago, met my s/o four and a half years ago, graduated college three and a half years ago, and was officially diagnosed three years ago. Currently, I'm back in school again pursing a nursing degree, I live with the love of my life, I'm on medication that makes things so much more bearable, and things are genuinely good.

Things get better. For me, things *are* better, but man, there are days. And today, my friends, is a day.

My OCD Story..,"Well.. Hello everyone my name is Sahil and I am from India. I am 17 years old.. And currently preparing for an entrance exam to become a doctor..  As this community is to support the ocd sufferers, it is a privilege to be here.. I would like to share my ocd journey.. 
 

Well.. My ocd was always there since my early teenage years but I never noticed it anyway.. Belonging to a orthodox muslim family in India, I got very religious and well my earliest ocd were religious ocds.. During my prayer times, the thoughts of hurting Gods would trigger me, I was small I didn't understood that so I thouggt it was my inner demon which consumed me.. So I thought its me, who was carrying those evil thoughts.. As time went by I became less religious my ocd was only triggered when I entered to mosque.. I then ignored it as I  didn't often gad too many visits. Situation became worse during final exam of class 9, I was doing below average in school, I was very weak in maths, Then somehow I typed and searched in internet about maths disability and the word dyscalculia strucked my mind.. After 4 or 5 seconds I lost track how could I add, subtract, my brain started to deny my calculations, I juxt broke down and started crying, I thought I had dyscalculia, my brother consoled me though I didn't know to figure the left or right hand of others so I became more convinced, then my brother just told me that u juxt have to reverse ur own hands, lol.. It took me seconds from then on.. I managed my intrusivity towards maths and bingo I did well in maths and got convinced I  didn't had any disability...
At the onset of class 10, I was preety darn focussed then my ocd took a worse turn, all creepy thoughts of failing in exam took me, I liked science but in class 9 I didn't do to well. So when I studied science, I felt my head ached  , my eyes sore, lol, I knew it wasn't true.. Somehow I managed nd gave the exam.. Well, I became one of the finest students in the class so this thought juxt got away..
I was focussed in my final exam, class 10 th examination in India was considered very important, I was religiously engrossed, things took ugly turn nd I found myself over nd over thoughts of killing Gods nd hurting prophets,.. I suppresed my thoughts often broken many days.. I somehow appeared in the exam and I did well
Now here I am, in class 11 struggling in a massive ocean of studies along with fighting ocd nd body dysmorphic disorder , when I was young my brother used to tease me about my jaws, now well it seems it paid off, I find my jaws my breaking in off... I tried meds from a prescribed doctor, doctor was only giving meds, no interest in therapies , after 2 months becze of side effects I quit.. Now here I am, living with ocd well I have been from d past few years, life had been difficult, we all know.. So here it was, Iknow it was long!

That incident really exacerbated my intrusive thoughts: I keep obsessing over being scrupulous about my work because I feel like everything somehow amounts to cheating! For instance, if the TAs solve some math problems in class, I feel anxious about using their solution, so much so that I deliberately leave the hw problems blank because I don't want to copy the solution that was discussed during official class time.

"Is this harm or responsibility OCD, or a mix of subtypes?","does having intrusive thoughts about bad events happening to your loved ones (crimes, accidents, illnesses, etc), and doing compulsions to prevent these things from happening, classify as a form of harm OCD or responsibility OCD? 

i've been plagued by this since i was very little, since i used to be convinced that my parents would die if they weren't in immediate reach, and in the worst cases i had really bad crises where i was deeply, absolutely and completely convinced that they HAD actually died in a car accident if they weren't home and no one could convince me otherwise.

if someone doesn't come back home before a certain time or doesn't answer texts, if their behavior is slightly unusual, i get extremely detailed intrusive thoughts about all the ways they could have died or been victims of crimes, i have to check the news to see if there's been any reported accidents, i call them even 20+ times in a row, check every single social media for their last traces, text the people they're out with and do a mental ritual of mine that i also use in general to prevent bad things from happening (repeating ""thank you thank you thank you"" in my head to replace bad thoughts with a good one, so the universe will know im grateful and i wont cause bad events with my bad thoughts). i got better but i still cant let go of the idea that thinking about something bad will make it happen and it will be my fault for causing harm to someone or myself.

if i notice anything slightly out of the norm like breath rhythm etc, i start having intrusive thoughts about them having a terminal disease so i start researching the symptoms and eventually do the ritual again. my latest episodes were about my dad dying from heart attack, my brother being electrocuted, and my sister being kidnapped when i had a missed call from her.

it also happens with crimes i hear about on the news etc. out the blue i'd get detailed thoughts about the victim experiencing the crime, especially those of sexual nature or extremely brutal ones, and not only they would frighten me because of the content, but also because i couldn't make sure that the victim was healing (i used to research online if they had left any interviews to know about their current state). on top of it, i was scared that if i kept thinking about these things, eventually those same crimes would happen to me. i'd make them real by thinking about them too much. so i'd have to do my ""thank you"" ritual again. 

im not sure how to classify all of this besides just calling it OCD, i've had lots of themes but this was always the most prominent and frightening one.",OCD,1574524691,flowerlaboratory,4,1,True,2019-11-23
Mental Illness and DALYs,"Hello. I wanted to share an idea which has helped me to some extent with my OCD.

DALYs stands for ""disability adjusted life years"". The idea includes counting the amount of ""healthy"" years lost due to being in a state of ill health.

I decided to take this concept and apply it to myself. I'm living the life, so I know it's bad, but just how bad is it? How many days have I lost due to obsessions? How many moments were suppose to be filled with joy but instead were plagued by excruciating anxiety? How many small, good moments have I lost and do I continuely to lose? It starts adding up. Yes, I can soldier on and conquer this day, but surviving a day isn't living it. Every second I spend on an obsession is a second that could've been spent doing something I enjoy.

I think one problem with having a mental illness of a ""manageable"" severity is that one can forget they are still being robbed even though they managed to get through the day (or at least that was the case for me). By doing this exercise I was able to realize how my compulsions, which mainly involved avoidance, was robbing me of wonderful experiences. My life was livable but very sub-optimal. Realizing the severity of the problem helped me beat some of my compulsions.

Struggling with a video game related issue.,"This is one symptom of a huge umbrella of issues I experience. Harm OCD and Relationship OCD being the chief two that have borderline ruined my life but I refuse to give up with and  will continue to recover from if it kills me in the process.  


Anyway, I seem to struggle with an over obsession and complication around games. I'd spend all day trying to explain the ins and outs, but I'll give this example. There will be a TL;DR because this is an absolute web like mess.  


Fallout 3. I decided to replay it. I did and I loved it. Not a hitch. So I rebuy New Vegas for the Xbox and play through it. Suddenly I feel as thought I've started a 'canon' storyline, and the New Vegas one I played wasn't right. It was too rushed, or not natural enough, or something. I'd also always had a character in mind to play with mods, and I felt like that was the 'right' one. But I didn't have a PC at the time so I played Fallout 4. 12 false starts, some as far as 30 hours into the game, before realising it didn't make sense to play this 'canon' storyline out of order like that and I had to play New Vegas with mods first. So I get a laptop. 8 months later I finally install it (it took me time to work up the courage to do it because I needed it to be right in my mind) and really enjoy it. Play 24 hours of it feeling like I'm going to finish the game.   


Tonight I realised over the past few days, I'd really wanted to play Fallout 4, but I was waiting til New Vegas was done... so I had started rushing through it. I decided that was true, I did want to finish this before playing 4 again, so I started to actively rush through it. So I sat it down to give it a rest. Then... I felt the desire to just get rid of it. I was so sick of it controlling me. The whole thing. So I went in, deleted 30 hours in and it actually felt really good to do it. It felt like a weight off.  And to be honest, I have no interest in playing it ever again. I felt trapped by it in the end.  


My problem is, how the hell do I stop this from happening again? I just want to play games and enjoy them.. I don't want to set up 'this is the canon character in the actual storyline in my head so it has to be perfect' thing ever again. I just want to enjoy myself.

My boyfriend's house makes me anxious,"I've had contamination OCD for a long time. Usually I can just avoid things that trigger it and I'm fine. But recently, since I've been hanging out at my boyfriend's house more, it's gotten worse. His family has two dogs and two cats inside. That would be fine but one of their dogs has accidents on the floor frequently and their cat's litter box is on carpet and I'm guessing it's not cleaned every day because their cats go outside of the litter box sometimes. I can't be there without having shoes on the whole time and I'm afraid to even sit on their couch with all of the dog hair that's on it. 

The other day when I finally did sit on their couch, one of their dogs brought something up there and was chewing on it. He told me to get it from the dog but 1) I didnt know what it was and 2) there was slobber all over it. I told him I couldn't do it. He got annoyed and picked it up for me. 

He knows about my OCD and I know that he doesn't know how OCD affects me and that's probably why he got annoyed for a bit. It just sucks that the only place I feel comfortable in his house is his room and that's only on his bed since he doesnt let the dogs up there. We're both high school students so he doesnt have time to deep clean his house and I get that but I dont know what to do. My intrusive thoughts are probably making me think he was a lot more upset than he actually was but I still don't know what to do about being anxious the second I enter his house. I have three cats so I know that accidents happen sometimes but if that does happen we clean it immediately and make sure that you cant smell it or see it so that people dont think our house is gross. 

I can't look at him and say ""yeah I think your house is gross and it triggers my contamination OCD"" so I'm stressed out.

How to get spouse to try medication?,"Throwaway account. 

How can I convince her to use medication? She thinks it‚Äôs unnecessary. Every single doctor or therapist she‚Äôs seen has told her she needs medication. She is not currently doing therapy because ‚Äúit‚Äôs useless‚Äù.

She keeps saying she‚Äôs going to ‚Äútry therapy again‚Äù instead of medication but keeps putting off additional therapy as well, so I think the therapy is a red herring excuse. She doesn‚Äôt have a fear of pills and she trusts doctors (almost to a fault) except when it comes to this issue.

Obsessions about obsessing?,"I have Pure O and this is my current theme. Since this recent flare up I‚Äôve mainly dealt with schizophrenia obsessions and having songs stuck in my head (neutral obsessions) and a bit of suicidal OCD, but the schizophrenia obsession has gone away for the most part, the songs are still there but I‚Äôm learning to accept them... however my new obsession seems to be, well... obsessing?

I don‚Äôt know what the actual fuck is going on in my head now but I have these overwhelming fears that I‚Äôm never going to get better, that I‚Äôm going to be stuck obsessing over anything for the rest of my life. Infact, for the last few weeks on and off I‚Äôve had thoughts like ‚Äúwhat if I obsess over every little thing?‚Äù And I go down this rabbit hole of racing thought worry. 

My thought process goes a bit like this...

So a feeling of dread comes on as I remember my ‚Äúobsession‚Äù, usually first thing in the morning.

Throughout the day I‚Äôll be hit over and over with the bad feelings / reminders.

then my head will go to thoughts such as:
‚Äúam I going to think like this forever‚Äù
‚ÄúI really hope not, that would suck‚Äù
‚ÄúBut how can I fix this obsession when it‚Äôs an obsession about obsessing‚Äù
Then I‚Äôll worry again that I‚Äôll never be able to get over it and start to think I‚Äôll end up killing myself or something

I think ultimately my suicidal ocd is still the main theme but my brain is contorting it and making me believe I have some sort of obsession loop that I‚Äôll never be able to figure out.

Has anyone experienced this?

I‚Äôll look at things and think ‚Äúwow, I could start obsessing about that, or that, or that, or that‚Äù

So it‚Äôs kind of an anxiety about potentially obsessing over every little thing?

Extreme Contamination Anxiety,"So I‚Äôve always felt anxiety ever since I was little, beginning with separation anxiety.  I would cry at school bc I was obsessed over the thought that my parents would die while I was at school and I‚Äôd be all alone.  This next part contains thing I would usually only tell a therapist.  Eventually, I hit puberty and for whatever reason, I began to experiment sexually with costumes and being restrained.  This eventually turned me towards bdsm and latex bondage.  For some reason, I think this might be all some subconscious effort to feel safe and secure. 

Now for the recent issues.   Last year I felt the urge to do something of sexual nature like this, even thought I feel disgusting and like a monster after.  I basically wrapped myself from head to toe in cling wrap.  Yes, I know it‚Äôs very very odd and to some, disturbing.  

Now, my OCD has made anything that the cling wrap has touched ‚Äúcontaminated‚Äù and if my phone falls on the floor where some of it was sitting back then, I have to Clorox whips my phone or I cannot go on.

Proud of myself/vent post.,"Ok first please don't take any of this the wrong way. I need to get it off my chest, both the good and bad parts of this story, and I'm not comfortable talking to friends about it yet. I don't enjoy these thoughts, and I don't want this post to make it seem like I do. I'm proud, but this is also a vent post, so be prepared for some good and just some rambling about my thoughts. 



Some background: I currently live with an emotionally abusive father, he's a perfectionist and is constantly yelling at me if the house isn't spotless. I also have pure O OCD, most often sexual intrusive thoughts. 


I've had almost all female teachers in my life, and all of them I've felt very comfortable around. This year, I had a male teacher. He is really nice and definitely cares about the class. He knows I'm mentally ill, and he checks on me frequently if I'm not doing great. He's a great person, and I look up to him, because he reminds me of the good traits of my dad. I enjoy the class, and I'm not attracted to him in any way. Lately I've been getting very sexual thoughts. Really about a lot of people, but it's bothering me so bad when they are about him, since I have to be around him in class constantly. It's science, so we have to move around the room a lot for labs and everything, but when I can, I sit all the way in the back, and say the bare minimum to him every day. I used to be fine, but I'm paranoid, and I think he knows that I have these thoughts, and it's so uncomfortable. I used to be perfectly fine in this class, but my OCD got bad a few months ago, and now I'm here. I avoid him when I can, and I'm failing. If I fail I have to retake the class. I'm not comfortable asking for ways to improve my grade. I don't know what to do now. 


Yesterday, I finally did something about this. It was really hard, and honestly it was something very small, but I'm proud. When you have thoughts like this, its hard to do the smallest things. I finally stood closer to him. I was uncomfortable, but I had to learn that it was ok. It turned out great. I didn't hurt him, and he didn't hurt me. Nothing I've thought about happened. It's not surprising that nothing happened, but I was so convinced by my thoughts that I thought that they would come true. I learned that that class is safer than I thought. I'm still not comfortable in there, but it just gave me some reassurance kind of. I'm working on exposure and this was part of it. 

Again, I'm not attracted to him, I just feel very unsafe because of my thoughts. I want to be comfortable in there so I don't fail. One of the most important things to me in school is to be comfortable in the classroom, and I'm not. I'm working on it. Please don't say anything rude, I'm really proud of finally doing something about these terrible thoughts, and I don't want to give up.",OCD,1574571195,danny_2898,0,1,True,2019-11-23
Do I have OCD and how could I get diagnosed?,"I‚Äôve got quite a few themes now but I‚Äôll start with the main one. 
So about a year ago I thought I was trans, after getting the thought ‚Äòyou‚Äôre a woman‚Äô I went to gender therapy (should have been ocd therapy) and had a breakdown and told all my friends I could be trans. Everyone was like cool if you are you are! Notice at this point I begin getting images of violence, people hanging from the ceiling, my neck snapping as I fall down stairs etc. Vile intrusive thoughts about family and strangers - yet I still didn‚Äôt know it could be OCD because like you know, your brain tells you you are the one wanting and thinking these thoughts. 
So I began intense mindfulness and meditation and self ERP as these trans thoughts ruined my life and made me suicidal. But I got to the point where I could get out of bed again and work, I remember sitting there crying and thinking ‚Äòyou‚Äôre not in the wrong body‚Äô about my trans thoughts. Recently a friend said to me out of the blue ‚Äòyou know those gender issues you‚Äôre having, I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre trans because you‚Äôd have done it by now‚Äô 
Anyways when I was ill I was convinced I was a paedophile, groinal responses and stuff, I‚Äôm also convinced I‚Äôm going to start hearing voices. I lay awake at night listening for voices and am extra aware of my ears. 
Not only this, I have been aware of my mouth and my breathing for over four years, nearly five, I had a period where I couldn‚Äôt get out of bed because of this. When I talk to people I am aware I‚Äôm controlling my mouth, I shy away and panic because I think they can tell I‚Äôm so aware of my mouth and it looks odd...so irrational but whatever. I noticed when I went on setraline most of these thoughts went away, this was a year ago I was on it for a year but felt very empty and depressed.

Please Read My Journal. Can You Help Me?,"Do other people think this obsessively about their own mental health? I‚Äôm obsessed with my mental health. It is all I think about. Is this some kind of OCD? It is painful. Triggers set off the symptoms and they get worse and worse for days and weeks. It‚Äôs physically and mentally exhausting. I feel physically stressed. Constantly worrying that my mental health will decrease. Worried that I‚Äôll go nervous, anxious, paranoid, crazy. Worried that I‚Äôll fall into a depression, again. Worried I will become an addict. Worried I‚Äôll do something stupid, something bad. Worried I‚Äôll lose control.... it‚Äôs like the waves wash over me and tip my ship over, sending me out into the water. And every time, I have to rebuild my raft. Sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm becoming a better raft builder, but then it just feels like the storms are hitting more frequently. The symptoms will rise up again and I‚Äôll lose control of my mind. Sometimes I feel that I‚Äôm getting better at healing my mental health afterwards, but it feels as if the breakdowns are happening more and more frequently.

I feel like I spend half of my days in this place. This mindset of fear, anxiety, loneliness. On the outside I suspect I look ok. No one seems to be able to tell that I am panicking on the inside. Waiting for them to call me out, to leave me, to make fun of me. Does everybody have this problem? Is this just low self esteem? Is low self esteem a serious thing or something that passes? How can I have low self esteem... I‚Äôm pretty successful for my age. But then again, I don‚Äôt really have parents. I‚Äôm losing my mind often too. How can I have high self esteem with these issues? Look at me now, here I go again off judging my self. This is one of the symptoms. When I‚Äôm in this place, my mind runs wild. I create scenarios, fantasies, about the state of my mind and health.

"I‚Äôm really struggling, please can anyone relate to these symptoms do they look like OCD?","A year ago after getting the thought ‚Äòyou‚Äôre a woman‚Äô I went to gender therapy (should have been ocd therapy) and had a breakdown and told all my friends I could be trans. Notice at this point I begin getting images of violence, people hanging from the ceiling, my neck snapping as I fall down stairs etc. Vile intrusive thoughts about family and strangers - yet I still didn‚Äôt know it could be OCD because like you know, your brain tells you you are the one wanting and thinking these thoughts. 
So I began intense mindfulness and meditation and self ERP as these trans thoughts ruined my life and made me suicidal - I really did not and don‚Äôt want to change my body (which is what it boils down to really). But I got to the point where I could get out of bed again and work, I remember sitting there crying and thinking ‚Äòyou‚Äôre not in the wrong body‚Äô about my trans thoughts. Recently a friend said to me out of the blue ‚Äòyou know those gender issues you‚Äôre having, I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre trans because you‚Äôd have done it by now‚Äô 
Anyways when I was ill with the flu it gets worse, I was convinced I was a paedophile, groinal responses and stuff, I‚Äôm also convinced I‚Äôm going to start hearing voices. I lay awake at night listening for voices and am extra aware of my ears. 
Not only this, I have been aware of my mouth and my breathing for over four years, nearly five, I had a period where I couldn‚Äôt get out of bed because of this. When I talk to people I am aware I‚Äôm controlling my mouth, I shy away and panic because I think they can tell I‚Äôm so aware of my mouth and it looks odd...so irrational but whatever.

Mistrust of symptoms and sensations.,"I've tagged this as ""potentially triggering"" because this is not a line of thought you would wish to follow. I did once and now I'm fucked.

So here's the deal. My OCD usually manifests itself as health anxiety (there are other things too, but minor). My main fear is heart related issues - heart attacks, coronary artery disease.

Before anything, I've been to multiple cardiologists and had lots of tests, which all yielded negative results, I have good genetics in that regards and zero risk factors. Also, I'm 24.

But the thing is I'm still terrified of having a heart related problem. I'm not asking for a solution to that, but in reality my question is about how I grew to mistrust my bodily sensations and symptoms.

Sometimes I walk up the stairs and ""feel"" chest pain or tightness. But I'm not really sure that I feel anything! I start obsessing over it and find no relief. I just mistrust my own sensations. And I'm like ""is this what chest pain feels like? Maybe I never had felt normal chest pain, and this strange sensation is in reality chest pain? And dangerous too!"".

It's easy to see how this sort of mindset can destroy your life. Also, when I feel this way, I can get intrusive images of people having severe cheat pain, and kinda"" feel"" that too.

Doubting my own memories,"Hi everybody so recently I‚Äôve had a phobia with contracting HIV it‚Äôs been about ten months since it started. It‚Äôs crossed into OCD because I have to double check everywhere I sit and everything I touch. Wash my hands frequently to make sure if I do get it I don‚Äôt spread it. Researching it. Playing over moments in my head. Recently it‚Äôs gotten to the point where if I don‚Äôt take pictures of something or record a moment I‚Äôm convinced there was a needle on it or that somebody stuck me with a needle. 

Most recently I went to a drive through and as I was ordering food a random man was walking by my car  and I started to get nervous because I KNOW I have this habit of convincing myself somebody stabbed me. He didn‚Äôt even walk close to my car if I remember correctly. He walked behind the ordering speaker and screen which was a decent distance away. Still close enough to see him but not to touch or anything. Despite my anxiety I continued my order like normal and can pretty much remember every instant (I have good memory)

HOWEVER, now my anxiety or ocd or whatever is convincing me that since I didn‚Äôt record that moment to be able look back and verify that nothing happened, that something DID happen. My mind is telling me that he did somehow make his way to me and stabbed with an infected needle and that I‚Äôm just repressing it. Brushing it off because I‚Äôm trying to deal with my anxiety and ocd and telling myself it‚Äôs not real when it really is. 

Realistically I know that if that were to happen I probably wouldn‚Äôt have carried on with paying with my order and stuff so casually. I‚Äôd probably panic and cry and the drive through speaker would probably notice?? (Then again McDonald‚Äôs workers aren‚Äôt very receptive). But I imagine I‚Äôd vividly remember that since I remember every other moment I‚Äôve been scared I gotten infected. I‚Äôve recorded and taken pictures of every part of my body so later I can reassure myself by seeing i didn‚Äôt bleed or have a wound mark but I don‚Äôt know I still feel like I‚Äôm gonna have to test in two weeks.

Rational answer to the irrational questions,"I have had various forms of pure ocd for seven years, including False Memory and Real Event OCD as well as others. In that time, I would craft explanations and justifications to help in accepting the catastrophic scenarios my brain would throw up. They would be succesfull, for a time. Sometimes for minutes, sometimes months.

Of course these mental compulsions only had one goal - reassurance. And they tried to get there by rationalising with the thoughts that OCD would throw up. 

I then spent years researching OCD and trying to practice self-designed ERP with mental scripts and practicing acceptance. This helped a great deal, but left a residual feeling of guilt and shame that never seemed to abate. 

A few months ago I changed my mindset. My thinking went like this. Dealing with OCD is like playing chess against yourself. You can't beat it because OCD knows every move you'd make. It knows how to counter your rational arguments and it knows how to hit you twice as hard where you are most vulnerable. 

So don't play the game. Walk away and say you won. And you will.

What I started doing - for the OCD themes that had been around for years and seemed imoveable - was to make a leap of faith that the thoughts were OCD and that they were therefore of no real consequence. That if I ever wanted to actually get better - and not just punish myself - then I would not argue or try to beat them, but reject them unconditionally. 

Tl;dr: Tried arguing with it. Got worse for years. Tried starving OCD by not giving it attention. Failed. Tried accepting the thoughts and living with uncertainty. Kinda worked.  Smacked the thought in the face while calling it fake news. Worked.

May not work for all. But it worked for me and I think there might be a few people with Real Event or False Memory OCD that might find this approach useful.",OCD,1574607465,Treejojo,2,1,True,2019-11-24

Before leaving I wanted to check I didn't leave anything under the bed, I feel this is normal and not excessive checking and omg there's a used condom under the bed. Like WTF. So now I'm even more freaked out, I mean who checks under the bed when they arrive into a room? Do I need to do that now???

OCD and chronic gatekeeping,"I googled ""OCD and gatekeeping"" to see if anyone else can relate to the following experiences, and unfortunately all I found were posts about people gatekeeping OCD itself,  or in other words, discussions about ""who REALLY has OCD."" So I want to clarify that this is not what this post is about, but rather it's about how gatekeeping itself has been really destructive for me due to my OCD.

I mean gatekeeping in the general sense: ""You're not REALLY an anime fan unless you've watched this many shows."" ""You're not a valid fan of the genre unless you have a comprehensive understanding of ALL the bands."" 

I grew up buying into gatekeeping nonsense, as many teenagers do, and like most teenagers I grew out of ascribing those standards to other people. But for myself? Ohhhh boy. Every hobby, every interest gets taken over by OCD. I never get to just DO something,  or just enjoy it.

I myself do not have OCD, however, someone very close to me does, so I'm intimately away for what OCD is and how it affect someone.

While I absolutely love this person (and do want to be home for the holidays), I don't know how I'll be able to deal with this. I already deal with anxiety, depression, and an off and on eating disorder, and being back in that environment is far from mentally healthy for me; in fact, it often triggers my ED (I have yet to have gone home during a break and not relapsed).

"Why we have every right to hate most of these stupid ""OCD jokes""","It seems like every single time someone posts one of these cringy ""obsessive coffee disorder"" things someone inevitably responds ""its just a joke""

The idea basically being that you are allowed to joke about anything, so you can't complain when they joke about OCD.

Now I'm about to say some shit a LOT of people will disagree with before even hearing me, so please, just listen to the end.

Here's the thing, you CAN joke about anything, **but you need to do it right.**

And the more sensitive the issue, the more careful you have to be.

And no, it's not a manner of taste, so don't give me that shit, there is method in comedy.

I know some are already ready to tell me that I'm wrong and you can't joke about ""anything"", and yes there are some things you effectively can't joke about because it's so difficult to make it work, but let me dig into why the belief of joking about anything is held, and why these stupid ass OCD jokes DON'T fucking work.

Here's the run down of why you're allowed to joke about ""anything"" before we continue.

All comedy is based around misery. 

Slapstick like Tom and Jerry is very literal misery, physical pain. Something like always sunny is the misery of the ridiculous shit that happens to the characters. Puns are a mockery of language and play to the part of your mind that can't stand things being misused. Shock humor (of any kind not just risque) is the misery that one feels when they are, well, shocked (that'll come back later). You get the idea.

Ask ANY comedian, and they'll say the same thing.

The reason why? Comedy is a defense mechanism, a coping mechanism. Something we use to combat the pain of life.

Basically, comedy takes something painful, and puts a ""comical"" twist on it, most commonly an unrealistic level of exaggeration, that will allow you to laugh at it and feel joy where there is otherwise just pain.

The pain involved needs to still be something that you are able to perceive as painful.

Using comedy, we are able to essentially laugh at the things that hurt us.

It's therapeutic. 

To quote Bo Burnham's song Sad (which talks about this in depth) 

&gt;Tragedy will be exclusively joked about  
Because my empathy is bumming me out  
Goodbye sadness  
Hello jokes  
Thank you very much 

It's a way we can take the things that hurt us and twist them into something positive. 

That being said, you can't just throw out negative things and expect them to get a laugh, there are several things you need to constantly remember.

For one, it needs to be, in some way, relatable.

You need the audience to be able to relate that thing to something in the real world they know is painful.

For example, in the early episodes of Tom and Jerry, they used actual cat screams instead of the human screams in the later show, the cat screams don't work nearly as well because it's not nearly as relatable, they still worked a bit, but not nearly as well.

And the second thing to remember is the concept of ""punching down"" 

Now, people often don't understand what that means.

Basically, you need to make sure that the thing that is painful is what is being mocked, and not the person who is in pain. 

For example, what's the difference between a joke ABOUT racism, and a joke that is racist. 

In a joke about racism, the joke is that racism is bad, that is the premise of the joke.

Meanwhile, in a joke that IS racist, like the old minstrel shows, the concept of the joke is that the race you are targeting is bad. 

Okay, but, what does this have to do with OCD.

Well, lets take this ""joke""

[reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/e0s97l/screw\_you\_hobby\_lobby\_i\_saw\_this\_today\_and\_it/](https://reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/e0s97l/screw_you_hobby_lobby_i_saw_this_today_and_it/)

Okay, so, the problem here is that it's using OCD, but the joke isn't ABOUT OCD.

Basically, the misery being mocked here ISN'T the misery brought about by OCD, but rather the misery of being obsessed with cupcakes. 

To go back to the concept of reliability, it is made to be relatable to people who like cupcakes a lot, rather than being relatable to the pain inflicted by OCD.

OCD is what's being used to exaggerate the ""obsession with cupcakes""

So, the reason we find this so insulting is because it is literally treating our debilitating disorder on the same level as Cupcakes. 

Now, this isn't to say you can't use something serious to exaggerate something, but when you do so you need to still make sure that your joke conveys the pain of the serious topic. 

The thing you're exaggerating needs to be REALLY bad to justify it, and the delivery still needs to make the thing that you're exaggerating with also seem really bad. 

Something that can be outright hilarious if done right, because it's almost like a double whammy, mocking two forms of suffering in one joke.

These, don't at all convey the pain of OCD, because they aren't made to be relatable to the pain of OCD, just the pain of, fucking cupcakes. It's just outright fucking insulting. Using the suffering of a group of often overlooked people in serious pain so you can giggle about your fucking cupcakes. 

I think the point I'm trying to make is that you can't use ""it's just a joke"" as a shield. 

Comedy is a powerful thing, but just like it can be used to heal, when used incorrectly or with mal-intention it can also seriously hurt. 

Anyways, I know nobody read this, but if you did, thank you for coming to my ted talk, and fuck these ""jokes""

"If you have OCD with video games, never play the original Rainbow Six series.","No game has ever driven my compulsions as badly as this old series. It's a ""realistic shooter"" where you take out the baddies and rescue hostages.

The ""replay"" system introduced in Rogue Spear doesn't actually record videos of your gameplay. Instead, it just saves the state of objects in the map and stores it all in a text file. So a replay is basically the game engine performing a live re-enactment. But, it doesn't capture all of the data precisely. This results in, for example, me standing at the exit outside a building, counting the rescued hostages, one two three four five six seven. Yes, seven, 100% certain, there are seven. Annnd seven, yep, definitely seven, I can finally complete the mission. Seven.

So I clicked on it and I was reading through the symptoms of OCD and my mind was blown on how things throughout my ENTIRE LIFE weren‚Äôt normal and how all things were all correlated.

Things like:
‚Ä¢Tapping fingers even amount of times on phone screen when playing games, etc.
‚Ä¢Reading an even number of Redding Posts/Memes
‚Ä¢Unusual and Very Disturbing thoughts that I in no way wanted or would seriously consider doing 
‚Ä¢Headaches, hurting fingers, and chills when I try to avoid doing a repetitive action like tapping my fingers all over my screen an even number of times
‚Ä¢When driving swerving right a little bit and then having to swerve left the same amount, I literally have avoided learning to drive to get my license due to this and thoughts of things like ‚Äúwhat if I just drove into this CVS for no reason‚Äù and things like that...

When your worst obsession becomes true,"I‚Äôve been diagnosed with our wonderful friend OCD since I was a kid, and have had all sorts of obsessions over the years. I guess the thing about OCD is that most obsessions and compulsions are not grounded in reality, for instance - I won‚Äôt get sick and die if I don‚Äôt wash my hands after touching a door handle at the mall. 

Here‚Äôs the thing though...so for the last few years my most relentless obsession and anxiety has been surrounding getting bedbugs. I would religiously check for them, and take measures to avoid places I could get them, like sitting on bus seats, etc. I never got them, although most nights when I would try to go to sleep I would get the sensation of bugs crawling on me. As time went on and I didn‚Äôt get them, I tried to challenge myself more and decrease my compulsive behaviours. 

Yesterday as I was cleaning my room, I saw three on my box spring. My anxiety went into overdrive, and the past two days have been tearing my apartment apart, spraying, and trying to control the panic.

Has anyone else encountered this? When their obsessions, that they tried to desperately control and tell themselves weren‚Äôt real actually occurred? I‚Äôm not doing well right now and am hoping someone might have some pro tips.",OCD,1574654338,NackJines,4,1,True,2019-11-24
OCD Self esteem ERP question,"Hello r/OCD!

   I'm new to Reddit, so I hope this posts correctly. I, 22(f) just recently got diagnosed with OCD. Lots of things are making  sense now (obsessions, ""protective"" rituals and intense fears about vomit, eyeball injuries, etc...) and I am going to therapy with an OCD specialist doing ERP. I'm also getting treated for depression, which my therapist thinks will lift when the OCD lifts as well. But I think I may have the depression, regardless of whether the OCD lifts. Actually, OCD and depression have felt like my 'personality' my whole life, sad to say. I am like a Tigger on the outside and an Eeyore and Piglet on the inside.

 The obsessions I am getting treated for are very tangible, but now I'm at a point where my self esteem and depression issues are bothering more, like:

""You're stupid, you're ugly, you're worthless...."" even though I am relatively smart, decent-looking, and people care about me! Even if i was 'stupid' or whatever, I should still love myself!!

I don't believe compliments and even if all my friends and family threw me a huge party and told me I was wonderful multiple times a day, I don't think it would budge these feelings. I would be grateful on the outside, but my doubt would not accept the compliments on the inside :(

I have been working on self-love and compassion but I get a nagging feeling that this self esteem stuff is OCD in disguise. Has anyone effectively used ERP or another method on OCD that looks like self esteem issues? How would you do it? Scripts about self hatred? What if I believed the scripts? (Oh no, a what-if statement...)

Intrusive thoughts about suicide,"So I‚Äôve had short bouts of SOCD (Suicidal OCD) in the past, normally lasting 1/2 days at the most, and normally in the middle of some other major health anxiety (epilepsy, heart attack, psychosis etc.)

However, recently I‚Äôve developed a severe worry about depression and suicide, and my intrusive thoughts about suicide have gotten much worse.

When I get these intrusive thoughts, for a split second I think to myself ‚ÄúI‚Äôd be better off dead‚Äù or ‚Äúdeath seems like an option‚Äù or ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt I just die‚Äù, but straight after these thoughts occur I‚Äôm instantly saying, often times aloud, ‚Äúno no no, I don‚Äôt want to do die, I don‚Äôt want to kill myself, I don‚Äôt want to be depressed‚Äù. 

I have a underlying fear of dying, which is the root cause of my health anxiety, so the very existence of these thoughts seem to make no sense.

The thing is, these thoughts feel so real and genuine in the moment when they‚Äôre happening, like I actually believe them, but then seconds later I‚Äôm freaking out and terrified that I was even considering those thoughts to be reality. 

I have a family history of depression so that doesn‚Äôt help my pre-established fears of becoming depressed and suicidal.

I don‚Äôt really have any compulsions to hide weapons/objects from myself for fear of a suicide attempt, as I‚Äôve never actually considered how I‚Äôd do it, so that‚Äôs at least a positive.

Tic disorders and OCD,"I'm sorry this is a long post.

I don't know a lot about OCD, I've never really thought anything of it but I've noticed a lot very recently, that I have a few 'rituals' is the only way I could describe it. I was diagnosed with a tic disorder and have had tics for a little over 11 months now but I always thought maybe the things I do were tics but some of them never really 'felt' like tics, if that makes sense?

A few examples are banging my head on things that are in front or behind me and hitting them with my hand or elbow if they're next to me (this includes walls, doors, people and doing it as hard as I can).
Locking my car door twice every single time I get out of it, even if there's people still in the car or I'm just running into somewhere quickly.
I have a lot of little things to do with my phone like I have to make sure I have absolutely no notifications, no open apps, my screen has to be on a certain page before I lock it and if i hear it go off I can't leave it unread even if I just get rid of the notification and don't look at it.
Light switches in my house are in pairs or threes so if the lights aren't all the same way when they're switched off then I have to go around and flick them all which means turning lights on and off at different switches.

IF YOU GET URGES TO DO THINGS YOU READ ABOUT THIS IS A TRIGGER WARNING

I've been thinking back to when my tics first started, it was around the start of the year and I didn't really know what was going on at the time but I was helping my friends do their housework and I decided I would help by ironing for them. I started thinking about what would happen if I put the hot iron on my face and wanted to do it so badly that my friend had to take the iron off md and I couldn't finish doing it because the urge to burn myself was so strong and I didn't know how tics worked so always just brushed it off. I have had a lot of these kind of thoughts and always thought it was normal or I was overthinking it or something. 
They're just really scary and I would like to understand why they might be happening but don't see my neurologist again for a couple months. I know no one can diagnose me on reddit but any information or personal experiences are appreciated",OCD,1574655950,summerthehippy,4,1,True,2019-11-24

Like that I don't really love my girlfriend or that she doesn't look so good anymore or that she will cheat on me if she goes out with her friends or that I will get bored of her or am I ready for this relationship and sometimes I am afraid that what If I am leading her on. And I feel like these thoughts aren't real like deep down I know that I don't want to leave her.

She makes me happy and I feel safe around her. We haven't even fought much. Like we have had few arguments but all of those were because of misunderstandings. Also at the beginning of our relationship I had intrusive thoughts about what If I am gay. I tried to figure it out for many weeks but then suddenly those thoughts passed and now I have these new thoughts.

Anyway I feel happy in my relationship but I have this nagging thought that what if I need to leave her. Like sometimes it feels like it must be done and it gets really exhausting to fight against that urge because I know that it isn't what I want. And my girlfriend knows about this and I have told her everything and she has been really supportive and understanding. It's one of the reasons why I want to be with her. 

I asked my psychologist that can this be OCD because I had made some research about it. She said that it is possible and now that I have talked about this with her few times she seems to be pretty sure that it is.

Please help I'm suffering from an unusual type of Pure-O OCD,"I've suffered from Pure O since I was 10 (didn't realise until I was 21, now 25) and its awful

But the last few months have been particularly bad as I recently went with a Trans escort (out of curiosity.) Having suffered from brutal HOCD during my teens the trans experience caused all the evil stuff to come flooding back because I did (theoretically) have an LGBT experience.

What has been particularly insidious recently however is something that I can't find anywhere on OCD sites. I've fallen into a hole where I have practically convinced myself that I am a latent rapist and murderer. It is absolutely sickening and is keeping me awake at night. I often have started 'testing' myself by reading rape cases to see what my reaction is (always total and utter revulsion) but the issue I now have is because of the experience with the trans escort (which I didn't enjoy at all) my OCD is now telling me 'well you thought that about being gay and look what happened.'

My low point came a week or so ago when I stayed round a girls for the night that I met online. We only cuddled and kissed, nothing more, but she blocked my number the next day.. despite reassurances from friends and family that I have done nothing wrong and these things happen I'm literally certain that I did something awful and shocking.

FUCK OCD,"I'm really really tired. I have been sufferring from OCD for almost a year till now. At first, it was HOCD, I had always known that I was straight, but something kept telling me I'm not.  Unwanted sexual thoughts and images about having sex with persons of the same sex drove me crazy. I watched straight porn to make sure I still had arousal for the opposite sex. I avoided images, movies have men in it. I pushed my close male friends away because of my sexual thoughts with them. My relationship with my parents was falling apart. My symptoms got worse when my friend died a couple of months ago. Every dreams, every amibitions I used to have was gone. I didn't want to do anything. I just feel very very tired. HOCD is not the only OCD I have. I also have difficulties in reading text. I keep re-reading text until I ‚Äòfeel‚Äô confident I have taken the text in correctly. My primary obsessional fear is that I might not understand the information correctly or miss something important from the text. It usually takes me 30 minutes (sometimes even worse ) to read a page of text. I used to like book, now I can't even read textbooks, novels, or even read the subtitles of movies. That's not all, I also fear ... my knowledge. I fear that I have taken everything wrong. Maths, meaning of words, ...etc . I scare that I didn't focused on class and have missed something important. I scared that I have to re-learn everything. I scare that I might not use words correctly, I kept looking up meaning of simple words again and again to make sure I understand it. I re-learned four arithmetic operations ( addition, subtraction, multiplication and division), searched their definitions on the Internet to make sure I take them in correctly. But that doesn't help, it keep coming back, my fear keep coming back, the question ""What if i still get it wrong?"" keep popping up in my head.

Ocd afraid that someone might get pregnant because of me (sexual content) (trigger warning),"Hello I am 21 years old and 2 days ago I went out to buy a kebab, but before that I masturbated (sorry for the detail) and washed my hands after that. there was a 5 Euro bill in my room, which I didn't use because I was afraid it has cum on it. Well I had no other bill at home to buy kebab so I took it used a wet towel to ""clean it"" and then I used a normal towel to dry it.

Put my joggers on and I went out and then I was afraid that there might be cum on my joggers coming through my pants.. I looked down to my joggers and I couldn't see anything and then I continued walking, some seconds later  the fear came in to my mind that I just touched my genital area through my joggers and that there is cum on my left hand.

 

I told myself no way I can't remember anything like that but at the same time I wasn't sure of myself. I wanted to go back but I was really hungry also. I thought trust yourself and went in and bought my kebab. Now I am afraid that the 5 Euro bill which I paid with has cum on it and that someone might get pregnant. Even worse is that when I went home I looked at my joggers again and saw one small wet area which was surely my cum, which my joggers absorbed it from my pants.

I am afraid that a female might touch the 5 euro bill and then for example go the toilet and then touch their genital area because they had to pee or something like that.. I feel so terrible, can anyone help me? Please..

I feel so terrible because if my ocd is right then I am disgusting.. I know that I strechted my joggers to see if there was a stain, I did it like 3 times and then went like ok there is nothing.

OCD or just my ADHD?,"I know you guys aren't necessarily going to be medical professionals, but it would be cool to get your opinion on this.

I was diagnosed this year at age 25 with ADHD, and have since been reading into OCD and feel I relate a lot to it.

A few things that I do, and have done for as long as I can remember (even back into childhood) include behaviours like:

- Scuffing one of my heels on the floor as I walk, and having to scuff the other foot at the same pressure. If it's weaker or stronger I have to balance it outby either scuffing again, or scuffing the other foot. If this goes on for too long I tell myself I have to 'reset' the count and hope my brain lets me move past it.

- Telling myself a family member will die if I don't do something again. For example, I throw something in the bin but miss and it lands on the floor. If I don't pick it up and put it in the bin, my dad will die. Or I put milk in the fridge but it's not quite straight in the door. If I don't straighten it out, my dad will die. It's really fucked up and I always do whatever it is that I think needs doing.

- Tensing my stomach. I get overwhelming compulsions to tense or tighten my stomach. The more I do it the more uncomfortable I feel and it starts to hurt/ache, but I have to keep doing it. It's like an intrusive though. 

- Sensory issues. I remember doing this a lot as a kid - less so now, but I still do. If a piece of paper is on a flat surface, if you rub your fingers on it, it sort of makes a noise and you can feel tension between your fingers and the paper. I HATE that, and it sets me on edge, but you bet I'll do it every damn time I see some paper on a table and then hate myself after.

- Cleaning and organisation. I am terrible at cleaning and organising because my ADHD and executive dysfunction etc. so I have a system and a rota for cleaning that works well. I obsess over it often though and tell myself bad things will happen if I don't get everything on the list done, like something might happen to my dog or something horrible. I feel scared sometimes into getting through the list.

Perceived Distance from Privilege and Mental Health Help-Seeking Intentions ?,"Hello OCD Subreddit!

I am looking for diverse individuals to complete an online IRB approved survey that will take approximately 15 to 20-minutes. To be included in the study, you must be at least 18 years of age, possess English proficiency, and be living in the United States. The survey has been approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB; STUDY00144682) at the University of Kansas. 

The current study is a part of my dissertation research, which examines the relationship between multiple diverse identities and help-seeking intentions for mental health concerns. The study possesses minimal risk and has the opportunity to directly benefit you by obtaining mental health and mental health service resources provided at the end of the online survey. Further, we believe that the information obtained from this study will help us gain a better understanding of how diverse groups perceive and intend to seek mental health services. 

The survey is available at the link below: 

https://kusurvey.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_a3LsUoJQqldAZud 

If you would like additional information concerning this study before or after it is completed, please feel free to contact me by phone or mail. I appreciate your time in completing the survey.

Coincidence OCD,"I had a massive psychotic episode back in February and I'm pretty much healed but now I have a religious OCD revolving around blasphemous thoughts that come in conjunction with external events that create a sense of coincidence or divine intervention. I keep seeing signs telling me I'm going to hell, among other things. For example, one day the devil in my head told me ""if I leave you I'm going to possess that man"" and I didn't reply.

Fear of Hearing voices/developing Schizoprenia,"Hello guys, I've been dealing with this for about 4 years total now. It started when I was 16 and I am now 20. It started after I did acid, and later read that it increases odds of developing schizoprenia. I've experienced a plethora of weird occurrences. Examples being two girls talking at work, and I thought I heard a guy talking and there was no guy. Loud thoughts that are my thoughts but are uncontrolled and very loud almost outside head. Thinking I hear random words or phrases in white noise. I've been diagnosed with GAD and obsessive personality. After these odd occurrences happen I'll try to recreate it in my head, because I feel like that will prove I'm not insane. The doc also said he take his chances on the lottery over me being schizoprenic. I'm just really worried that's all, but at the same time idk why because I know nowadays it's very treatable.

getting close to people hurts,"I'm not sure if this is OCD or if it's just a problem I have, but when I meet someone and can tell I want more from them than just friendship (in some cases that means romance, in others it simply means a closer bond than what I consider I have with most of my ""friends""), I immediately go into this position of not really knowing how to act as to not mess up, or I just don't show much emotion toward the person so that I don't admit to myself I care.

It's been a consistent problem in my life. I don't allow myself to get close to people because I'm afraid of the inevitable disappointment.

Lately I've been coming to terms with the fact that I'm attracted to this person I know. It's been difficult because of the fact that I don't know whether or not what I'm feeling is mutual (I know he's attracted to me, I just don't know how far the attraction goes) so trying to admit to myself that I may want some kind of romantic relationship is hard. But when little things happen that make it seem to me like he doesn't care that much, even though they don't necessarily mean that at all and I just assume they do (an OCD thing I'm sure, I get obsessive and attached easily despite how I rarely/never show it), it makes me instantly second guess everything and want to push the person away as to not look like I care more than they do so that I can avoid being hurt more than I already am. Something like that happened today and I want to push him away but I don't, because I know that would ultimately ruin things, not anything he's done.

It's self-sabotage, I think. I don't really know, but does anybody have advice for what to do in this situation? It happens rarely but still more than I like, and always when I really like someone. I don't know how to fix it.",OCD,1574702404,sadnoodleboi,0,1,True,2019-11-25

Bathroom related OCD?,"So I‚Äôve had OCD since I was pretty young, 10 or 12 years old was when it started I believe. I‚Äôve had a lot of different fears and obsessions, they have changed throughout the years. I finally had enough and went to a therapist when I was 20, a few years ago, and she really helped me learn some techniques to deal with OCD. It was mostly CBT and exposure therapy. Recently I‚Äôve had GI issues that I‚Äôm working to get resolved, and am unsure if I have IBS or IBD or something like SIBO. I have to use the restroom multiple times a day usually and have pain sometimes or discomfort fairly often. Sometimes I get really bad urgency which creates problems. Now I have a pretty bad fear of not knowing where the closest bathroom is. It‚Äôs hard for me to go do things with friends, go to bars, restaurants, as I‚Äôm always nervous the bathroom will be occupied or there won‚Äôt be one around. Is this an OCD fear? Or is it a normal fear regarding the physical symptoms? Going out to places can cause anxiety which makes me feel like I need the bathroom. I‚Äôve seen other people struggle with this, mostly on the IBS sub. Any tips or insight? Note: I‚Äôm not scared of germs or using public restrooms, which I know can be a common fear related to OCD.

Having OCD-like thoughts about my relationship with my boyfriend and my health (hypochondria). Should I tell my boyfriend and/or my mum?,"TL;DR: having OCD-like thoughts concerning my relationship with my boyfriend and concerning my health. My mother is diagnosed with OCD and is very open about it with me. Should I tell my mother and my boyfriend about these thoughts? I don't want to burden them with things they can't do anything about, especially not my boyfriend because he probably won't really understand it as well as my mother.


---

So, I'll start off by saying I don't have a diagnosis. However, my mother was diagnosed with OCD and is very open about it. She mostly has harm OCD thoughts, which is more like the ""pure O"" type OCD. She has also had hypochondriac thoughts, but she kind of fought through that and doesn't have that anymore. 

Like I said, she's very open about it. I feel like I know fairly well how OCD works because I'm a psychology major but mostly because my mother has told me a lot about what she's struggling with. And I'm thankful for that, because if it wasn't for her, I probably would never have come to the conclusion that the thoughts I'm having are OCD, and not my intuition for example. 

Maybe I wouldn't get diagnosed with OCD, I'm not sure. But the thought patterns I have are exactly the same as what my mother describes. When she talks about her OCD, I can apply the biggest part of it to myself. So maybe I wouldn't meet all the criteria for a diagnosis, but these thought patterns I'm having definitely are unhealthy and they're causing me a lot of distress. 

So anyway. My obsessions are mostly about my relationship with my boyfriend. I'm always worried I don't love him enough, and I compulsively react to that by looking for reasons why I do love him. I also over-analyse everything about my relationship, and notice everything about us that isn't perfect. It's extremely tiring to validate my love for him every day, and because of it I'm not even sure what's really me or what's just the voice of fear, pretty much. One of my biggest fears is that I don't love him enough and somehow break his heart because of it. He's the sweetest guy I know, and he's honestly the most honest, trustworthy guy I could ever ask for. If I were to break his heart, it'd destroy me, too. Because he just does not deserve any of that. So because I fear this, naturally, this is what my OCD holds on to. 

I've also lost a lot of people around me the past two years. It has made me pretty scared of losing the people I still have, because it really made me feel how fickle life really is. It also makes very scared to get seriously ill. So I've been checking my body a lot. In the past week, I've had three different spots on my body that I extensively researched because I was afraid it was cancer. 

I did actually tell my mother about two of those bumps on my skin, and she looked at one of them and told me I should get them checked out if I was _really_ worried, but that it did sound a lot like hypochondria to her, especially because I told her the worrying gets worse when I get really stressed. However, I only told her about the body checking thing. Not about the relationship OCD symptoms. 

Would it be smart to tell her? I'm afraid she'd blame herself or something and be really worried if I told her I think I have OCD. But I think she's the only person around me who would actually understand. I feel like most of my friends mean very well, but would probably not really understand and maybe even feed into the obsessions. 

I also kind of feel the need to tell my boyfriend. I just don't want to make him doubt my love for him and worry about all of that, and I'm also afraid he maybe wouldn't understand. I mean, my dad doesn't really understand my mum's OCD, either. OCD is just not something that is easy to explain, I guess. Especially not pure-O OCD. 

Right now I'm sort of dealing with listening to and reading self-help content online, so I'm not set on getting actual psychotherapy just yet. I want to try this out first. But being able to talk to someone about it would probably really help, you know?",OCD,1574703224,thespyingdutchman,1,1,True,2019-11-25

"An email sent to my dismissive therapist that disrespects my boundaries, and does mental gymnastics to justify violations of said boundaries.","This is what I sent to my therapist after going back and forth with her on a boundary I keep having to remind her of. She insists on justifying why she violates my boundaries. She has triggered me countless times, and I've only been seeing her for one month.

[Trigger warning for those sensitive to confrontations. The email begins below this line of text]:

I cant wait around until next week. This needs to be addressed now. I don't understand why you're so adamant against communicating via email; that's how people communicate. I don't have the luxury of waiting around or paying tolls driving to your office just to have a conversation with you. That's not how a therapist-to-patient relationship works. All my other past therapists were fine with this. Your behavior is sketchy and gives off the impression that you only want to see me in person just to make more money. Email is just as sufficient as a face-to-face conversation. I'd wager it's even better than face to face because I can really think about what's on my mind without backtracking like a face to face conversation would entail.

I seriously don't understand how much clearer I can be to you. I specifically request that you stop saying negatively-reinforcing phrases like ""You're in a bad situation right now"" and ""You're suffering"" and leaving it at that because although it recognizes my problems, it doesn't give me hope. Things aren't black and white. Everything needs a balance. Imagine you're going though one of the worst times of your life and someone just tells you ""Yeah your situation is really bad right now"" and adds
nothing more, giving me nothing inspiring to work with. I really hope you know the difference between toxic positivity and hopeful validation.

I'm not asking for zero positivity when I ask that people recognize my problems. I ask that people recognize my issues, while also offering positivity that applies to my situation, and not one-size-fits-all, baseless, surface level remarks like ""You'll get over it!"" and ""Just be positive!""

There's a happy medium, you know. I thought that it was your job to know this. I hope you learned this while getting your degree, because if you didn't, I find it really sad that a 19 year old with next to zero college experience can find more insight on the internet than a licensed professional.

Hopefully you understand what I'm trying to get through to you now. I'm not obligated to list my reasons, but this is the third red flag you've given off to me. I'm not sure I want to throw away any more money and time and cause more aggravation and stress on my end if I have to correct a so-called professional on something they should already know how to do.",OCD,1574707562,PMmeSnakePics,24,1,True,2019-11-25

Touching / Contaminating My Tech &amp; Electronics,"Hello everyone, first of all, I want to thank the Reddit community for being here and being so open, also I've finally decided to take a shot at posting, after years of just reading, so here it goes. Please don't judge, I'm just trying to have a discussion and get people's opinion and have a nice convo. :) 

So here it goes...

A while back, I started being obsessed about washing my hands before I touch my electronics, laptop, phone, etc. or any other things. I get anxious when I see people around me eating stuff, and then approach me to either shake my hand or just plain and simple maybe touch something that is mine. 

I know salt corrodes things, and that's why I'm super paranoic for my electronics not to get affected by this ""second-hand salt"" interaction from foods... I love my tech as any tech guy would say, but even I know at this point that this is becoming a problem. 

After eating a burger or other food that you might eat with your hand, one would wash their hands once, and be done with it, and move on with their lives. Well, not me... I wash like 4 times, and also rub my hands with alcohol wipes to make sure ""nothing"" that might not be spotted with the naked eye is there...

I guess, I just want to know if any of these ""fears"" are real and if I'm not exaggerating everything, even though I'm pretty positive I am.

I'm tired of repeatedly washing my hands till they blister just to get relief of feeling that my hands ""are clean"" in order to touch my things, also be constantly on the lookout if someone didn't touch a door handle that I might use, or my things with a greasy/salted hand after eating a meal, or just leaving stuff in my space, that is food or dirty... 

If there is someone out there with a similar struggle, I'd like to hear from you :) I would appreciate any advice and I do appreciate a friendly/healthy discussion. Thank you.",OCD,1574709183,remzeyy,1,1,True,2019-11-25

Or, ""I want to be trans even thought I'm not"" which is x100 worse. I know they're just twisted thoughts, but they're ruining my mental health since they started in August.

I‚Äôm working on getting rid of my ‚Äúhoard‚Äù,"I‚Äôm about to graduate college and move out of the dorms, and my dad is about to move out of my childhood home, where the majority of my belongings are. I knew I had hoarding tendencies, but didn‚Äôt realize how much I really had until I began to visualize what all my belongings would look like in a small apartment. I knew I couldn‚Äôt bring all that stuff with me, and I didn‚Äôt want to burden my dad with my clutter. But more importantly, I looked at all my things and I realized I had a problem that could spiral out of control one day if I didn‚Äôt stop it now. 

I‚Äôm keeping two boxes of ‚Äúkeepsakes‚Äù which has helped a lot. I‚Äôm really bad about holding onto any item that has a memory attached to it, so the two boxes allow me to still keep the actual significant stuff. 

I‚Äôm also bad about hoarding items that ‚ÄúI might use for an art project‚Äù. So for that I‚Äôm getting rid of anything easily replaceable, and keeping a box of actually unique objects. I‚Äôm also breaking down these objects as much as I can, like I legitimately do frequently reuse old t-shirts to make patches, so instead of keeping stacks of shirts I‚Äôm cutting out the graphics and keeping them in my box of fabric. For the electronic stuff I hoard and use in my work I‚Äôm breaking it down and organizing the pieces, so instead of holding onto a robo raptor I‚Äôm holding onto a small box of gears and such. 

I‚Äôve actually been working on this since the summer, and it gets easier every time. I‚Äôm at the point where I can go into my room and toss things without much hesitation :) (usually)  it‚Äôs break week so I‚Äôm going to try to actually finish this once and for all.

It‚Äôs embarrassing as hell being a grown man and feeling guilty for tossing a teddy bear. I‚Äôm getting through it though. I do wish I had a kid in my life to have a toy story 3 moment with haha.

I developed a new ritual (or tic?? idk) once I got to college.

Obbsessing over not looking at peoples body when talking to them. Felling disgusting and obsession about smelling. Help? Anyone else?,"I don't know if I have OCD or not but I think I have intrusive thoughts. I have always been shy about sexual things and have been raised in a very religious family where things like that are very taboo and not ever joked or talked about and deemed inappropriate to do so. A year or so ago I developed this obsession of not being a pervert. Im 17 and not interested in sex or don't have much thoughts when I'm alone but when I'm around peoole I start to think about how I shouldn't look at their body and only focus on their eyes or else they'll think I'm a pervert. I do have quite bad social anxiety so eye contact already is hard for me and this way, because I think of not looking at people's body when talking I'm afraid my eyes shake and stray and I look weird. I try so hard not to look at peoples body's but this results in my eyes kinda shaking and people notice this and think I'm a pervert and a weirdo. I have a really hard time talking to people already and this makes me even more insecure and makes me not wanna be face to face or around anyone. Am I actually a pervert. Why does this thing come to my mind when I should be normally talking to peope. And the fact that people can notice this makes it the worst. I've had obsessions about hiding my face in public because I thought people are disgusted when they see me and I would try to cover my face with my hair as much as possible , And I've had obsessions over walking a certain way so people don't find me weird and sitting in my seat normally because people sitting behind me can see me and observe my movements , I also think I constantly smell and people are disturbed by me which also drives me crazy because i really can't tell if I do actually smell or not am i imagining things am I over  analyzing that people touch their noses and turn away their faces and open windows and have disgusted expressions when they look at me , however among all the other insecurities and obsessions this one is the most disgusting one. Why do I think of this. 
Other people don't have to put effort into not looking at people's body's when talking and the fact that I do says something about me. 


As I said I struggle with the thought of being disgusting and looking disgusting and smelling too. People always touch their nose around me and start to wipe their nose because bad smell makes you really nose stuffy and they open windows too and also when they look at me they have a disgusted expression. I think the smell is coming from my mouth but I brush my teeth everyday but because I can't eat in public( it makes me panic and also I feel like puking when I try to) I am always empty stomach at school and you know you have a bad smell in your mouth when you're hungry I think that happens. But then again this didn't use to be a thing I used to not eat as a child for other reasons but I did t ever think that I could be smelling so I do t know if it's not real or a recent developed problem in my stomach. Also this happens only when I'm nervous like in school or on public. When I'm home my mother doesn't get any smell even if im hungry. I don't know what king of stomach issue would be triggered by nervousness but If any of you know let me know please. 





I have other issues with being independent and taking care of my own self and socializing and communication ( like doing shopping, going out in public on my own, doing my own appointments registrations and stuff , using public transport- let alone driving- , having proper conversations with people, using enough vocabulary that my peers are able to use while talkking basically talking like I'm 10 years old , hugging people , sitting next to or in front of people acting normal while talking walking sitting etc etc) but I think they are more related to social anxiety than OCD. I don't exactly know what I'm diagnosed with as my psychiatrist never told me and I can't ask. I can't talk about these things with her either so I don't think she would be able to diagnose me. 



I know this is very long and maybe spesific but, Is this any similar to any of what you guys are going through? Maybe anyone that has similar things to stuff I stated above. If you have gone through anything similar please let me know and if you have overcame anything like this also please please let me know. How was the whole process and are the thoughts still there or are they completely gone? 

Any help is very much appreciated.",OCD,1574711759,weird-freak,3,1,True,2019-11-25

Compliments from strangers are the absolute worst.,"I had a doctors appointment for my broken foot today, checking how it was healing, and finding out when I could return to work. 

When I was through, I had to wait about 30 min for my ride to get there, so I just sat in the waiting room to wait it out.  Mind you, the chairs are in rows facing each other, almost forcing some type of interaction. 

An elderly couple walked in, sat down directly in front of me and asked how I was, no big deal. I told them what happened, and he said ‚ÄúYou have a really nice beard ‚Äú and I felt it ramping up. 

‚ÄúThank you, I haven‚Äôt shaved in a while‚Äù I said, and immediately here came the ole intrusive thoughts. I‚Äôm going to list them off, as it‚Äôs silly to see them but miserable in the moment. 

He said I have a nice beard what if he‚Äôs lying or can‚Äôt grow one himself. 

He‚Äôs probably looking at you waiting to talk why aren‚Äôt you looking. 

Why didn‚Äôt you compliment him on something holy shit are you dumb. 

Don‚Äôt just sit there in silence look around. Look at the floor. Not that much. Look outside. 

Rub your hands together or something. Now tap them together like Rocko from the cartoon. Shit what if he knows what I‚Äôm doing. 

You‚Äôre sweating why are you sweating now he‚Äôs onto you I bet he regrets giving you a compliment. 

He‚Äôs looking around a lot I bet he thinks you‚Äôre awkward as hell. 

He noticed your counting the patterns on the carpet. God you‚Äôre an idiot. 

What if you just bashed his head in with that potted plant. God everyone would be so upset. 

Imagine if you killed everyone in there. It‚Äôd be horrible. Your entire family would be so ashamed of you. 

Everyone in here is laughing at you inside I know it. 

Great now your forehead is visibly wet, disgusting. 

Act like your calling someone. (I did this 5 times). Nobody answered now you look stupid. 

Now everyone is looking you good job. Text your ride to make sure they‚Äôre still coming. Bet they aren‚Äôt. 

HOLY SHIT they‚Äôre here ok look out the window and watch them come in, not too fast, not too slow. 

Ok get up quick, grab your crutches and say thank you and leave. Say it twice.

I don‚Äôt know if this is OCD, since I currently (and pretty much always) have always just suffered what I would call Pure O.

I used to be super anxious about going to school- what someone left the plug on, what if I walk around the corner to my house and it was on fire. Like, all those ‚Äòwhat if‚Äô questions. I remember bringing my favourite teddy in my bag to school for a few weeks because I was so scared it would be gone when I got home. Honestly... I can‚Äôt differentiate between being a child and if that was OCD or not.

My second point, is I am essentially an insomniac. Physically cannot sleep, no matter how much I try, because my brain is so active. It‚Äôs focussing I‚Äôm on whatever I‚Äôve spent my day obsessing about- replaying moments I could have messed up in my compulsions or a new situation that brings more anxiety. Then I‚Äôm so tired the next few days I can‚Äôt function.

Intrusive thoughts or actual delusion,"Let me preface this: I know I do have OCD, and I'm familiar with reassurance and how unhelpful it is.  However, I'm posting this anyway, because I feel like I'm stuck in a bit of a limbo, and could use some insight.

If you go back two weeks, I would describe myself as fairly normal, with the exception of OCD (and possibly DPDR), which in my opinion, makes me much cooler than normal people.

However, a few days ago, my therapist dropped the good news that they need to test me to rule out schizophrenia.  Considering this is an OCD sub, you likely know where this is going.  Horrible anxiety, hypersensitivity to sounds, reassurance-seeking (did my wife hear that noise), and all the good stuff.  Normally, sitting with this might be fine, but it's going to take two weeks to even get the testing done, plus another week to get results; I nearly took myself to the ER, simply because of how goddam stressed this is making me.

Now, here's the rub: a few days ago, I experienced what I'm hoping was just an intrusive thought.  I saw a plane, which became a government plane, which meant they were looking for me.  The rational part of me says that's insane and a waste of tax money, but part of me thinks or feels that I believed the thought, if even for a second.  

This is where I need help.  I can't tell if I had another intrusive thought, or if I'm beginning the downward fun-land slide to full-blown delusions and schizophrenia.",OCD,1574734700,TheFakeZzig,11,1,True,2019-11-25

OCD False memories and POCD of past mistakes,"I'll keep it brief because I already made a similar post on Psychforums, but just really want ti get everything off my chest because the therapy doesn't help. I recently re-watched an episode of Black Mirror after a few years - I loved there episode when I first watched it and I wasn't really affected - and I started to worry and get extreme panic attacks.

The episode was Shut up and dance (if you watched the episode then you know where I'm going with this). The episode triggered a lost memory I had of my 13-15 year old self exploring different types of porn and coming across a lot of underage girls. I've been having a lot of intrusive thoughts and false memories of the events so I can't remember all the details but I remember visiting the images (I found them on google images) and masturbating to them multiple times. I saved a shit ton of them, as I do with all the porn I find, including instagram pics. 

I'm 16 now but remembering this event led me into a dark place I struggle to get out of, I keep getting false memories, obsessive thoughts, a shit ton of intrusive and thoughts that I kept me questioning myself as a person and a human being, and many curiosities on darker subject matter and wanting to explore. 

The worse thing for me was giving up my favorite hobby, watching movies, mostly because my memories and regrets spring back up whenever I see a child on screen or something relating to a pervert, rapist, peso, etc...

I was never comfortable around kids to begin with, mostly cause I feared I would be attracted to them or hurt them, but this whole experience worsened everything and I started to repetitively hit myself whenever I had the thoughts. I sometimes got turned on by one of the thoughts but that just led to me crying or having a panic attack.

  It has gotten so bad that my thoughts and my actual self are hard to separate, making me fear who I really am.

  I can't even masturbate to classmates or porn without having an urge or curiosity to look it up, or even images of kids which makes me feel more ashamed when I finish.

   I always fantasized about girls in my school, them being a lot shorter than I was, but I always replace the thought of them with a girl A LOT younger than me and it forced my to give up masturbating for a few days.

I was able to ignore the curious thoughts in my head sometimes but they always sprung up again after a while. The thoughts were mainly targeted towards finding more of the underage images and grotesque videos on the dark web just out of curiosity. I knew just viewing these would make my guilt, shame, and fear worsen. I keep getting night terrors and images of hurting or abusing children and infants. These don't help my migraines and also worsened my self-esteem and anxiety. 

   I was diagnosed with OCD and PTSD a while ago but it doesn't really help my thoughts and my curiosities.  I just hope to find someway to return to my normal self and continue my love for movies like before.

Most of the time, I feel numb or tired or sad, and I just want to drink. I supposedly have pure OCD, but it seems that with mental health in present day circumstances, professionals won‚Äôt definitively tell me whether or not I have it, they just seem to go along with me based on internet research I‚Äôve done. And of course, that just isn‚Äôt enough to convince me or make me feel better. 

When I was little, I would go through periods where I‚Äôd convince myself I was going to hell for whatever reason. Later on in my teens, I‚Äôd convince myself that I was pregnant, even though I was still a virgin. I‚Äôd have to give myself pregnancy tests to convince myself I wasn‚Äôt, and sometimes even that wasn‚Äôt enough. My current intrusive thoughts are more centered around me being gay, even though I know I‚Äôm not. It‚Äôs extremely frustrating because it makes me feel guilty, like I‚Äôm some homophobe or something. It‚Äôs also incredibly difficult because, of course, there‚Äôs no test you can take to know your sexual orientation, so I can never chase away these intrusive thoughts because there‚Äôs always that possibility that I‚Äôm just repressing my sexuality. Who knows. 

I don‚Äôt really know why I‚Äôm posting this. I‚Äôm not seeking reassurance because I know that won‚Äôt help. I‚Äôve been a lurker on reddit for years, and that‚Äôs been fine with me. I guess I‚Äôm feeling especially alone and especially sad. For some reason, I just felt like shouting into the void.",OCD,1574736399,torigm,3,1,True,2019-11-25
How do you get through college?,"Every time I try to study I get barraged by intrusive thoughts, and it's so disturbing that I can't concentrate and usually give up early. I've been trying to get psychiatric help all semester. I've gone to counseling on campus, and they couldn't help. I tried medication, and it made things worse. I've called outside centers, but now there's only two weeks left of the semester, so there's not really time anymore to pull my mental health together before finals.

On top of struggling with disturbing intrusive thoughts, I've been telling myself I'm doing it on purpose. I'm having these problems on purpose so I can have an excuse to not try hard enough in my classes. I really want to graduate sometime soon. I don't want to fail my classes or do a medical drop. I want to be an engineer. I'm so sick of struggling. 

Are there any quick fixes to get through tough times like this? How can I make my brain shut up, or force myself to push through it? I feel like I have no willpower.

Struggling to beat my pocd,"I'm gonna start this off with a disclaimer because I'm gonna talk about my struggle in full detail because quite frankly I dont know how else to open up about this. So I'm 15 and I've been struggling with pocd since February of this year and it's pretty much ruined my whole year. I dont have access to therapy due to ignorant parents and all I can do is work on ERP. I've overcome most of my obsessions in the past month hit for some reason one obsession wont get out of my mind.

Yesterday I was doing just fine and I was masturbating to perfectly healthy things but the thoughs of my brother wouldn't leave my head. I started to feel like the thoughts of him gave me more of a feeling of arousal and before I knew it I was testing myself to the thoughts of him.

How to cope with major contamination OCD?,"It feels like it's tightening its grasp on me little by little, it's so bad that i end up spending my entire day in bed because it's easier than the mental gymnastics i have to pull just to be comfortable in my home.

I don't sit anywhere besides my bed because every other spot Feels like it's full of germs, oils, grease, ect. And if my clothes graze the wall i take them off before sitting on my bed. If i touch anything i have to wash my hands or i feel nausea from my hands being somehow gross.

And for stress relief from all that id play videogames or get better at programming, but because im afraid to touch my keyboard and mouse while sitting on my chair, i avoid it. And it sucks because they're things i try to do every day but end up struggling over.

I feel like if i just tell myself that it's okay it'll be okay but it's not, the stress i get from seeing it just makes me get sad and angry from not being able to even enjoy life anymore over something as stupid as my own hands.

I feel like my body is constantly dirty due to things like oil, sweat, and other gunk bodies produce, and even though ive touched my pc many times it's gotten harder this year because im afraid my oily disgusting skin will contaminate the keyboard and mouse somehow, and i don't know how to get out of it.

 It feels like I'm at my wits end after 2 months straight of not being able to enjoy anything, because if i do I'll have to wash my hands until my hands dry out and crack and that gets into my head because our hands will make even more oil to compensate for it, only making matters worse.

Tldr: i can't stand my natural body fluids feeling like I'm somehow ruining things the more i touch it, and no matter how many times I've tried to rationalize it to myself over and over nothing ever works and gets worse, so bad that all month I've spent in bed doing nothing because of how tiresom it is dealing with this every second of every day.

rant: do NOT force your OCD on other people for fuck's sake,"Note: I have OCD and misophonia myself and have been diagnosed since senior year of high school. Been dealing it since I was a kid.

So newsflash: my brother has OCD. I did not know that-- I just learned that today when my brother yelled it at the dinner table today. I knew he suffered from anxiety and anger issues (which I don't think he's aware of). This is all new to me, but it makes sense. I understand what it's like to have OCD, and I get it. I really do. I've been dealing with this since I was a kid so I know.

But what stopped me from being sympathethic and kind is that he yelled at my mother for having too much food in the refrigerator. Said it was triggering him and that she needed to stop. He yelled out that he had OCD and that he needed exposure therapy, but kept nagging my mother to stop stocking her refrigerator. She said that she was only doing that for Thanksgiving and for Christmas dinner, but he was not having it. He yelled some more, demanded that we do as he says, then stormed into his room. As I'm typing this, he just came out of his room to argue with my mom some more.

Dude I fucking get it, but there is NO FUCKING REASON to force your OCD on someone else. If it gives you anxiety, then POLITELY tell Mom. OCD is something that you need to deal with yourself. Don't get me wrong, support is always appreciated and helping people understand makes it easier to bear, but there is absolutely no reason to force it on someone else. Just because it makes you uncomfortable doesn't mean that someone else should be uncomfortable as well. It doesn't mean you can yell and throw fits and order people around. It's difficult, but it's something you need to face and deal with. Reach out for help, but don't bite the hands of those who want to help you.

Honestly I want it to end here, but my mother is an enabler and totally agreed to what he said. And I when I told my brother about not forcing it on other people, my mom yelled at me when he left. Told me that I was the one causing trouble, and that I should be supportive and helpful. She also told me that I was essentially being an elitist asshole (I just didn't want him to continue shitting on her). She then continued to mutter about how we're the odd ones in the family and how she doesn't have it but how come her children have it it makes no sense. Like ??? I was just trying to help???? Probably I made a poor choice about the timing, but seriously wtf? Even though I live with her and he's only back for winter vacation, she STILL favors him (lowkey that Confucius says bullshit). 

I'm just tired, guys. I'm so fucking tired. I'm used to dealing with shitty toxic behavior on the daily basis, but this was a whole lot. Now I'm trapped in my room, afraid to leave my room lest one of them decides to play family's punching bag with me. I already took my things out of the living room and the bathroom I share with my brother just in case he decides to sabotage and destroy my things. I'm so fucking tired of dealing with this bullshit.

Incessantly Rearranging Apps,"I believe that since I‚Äôve had an iphone (6ish years or so now) I‚Äôve had the compulsion to incessantly switch around my apps throughout the day until they look pleasing.

Over the last year or so, simply looking at it began to drive my crazy. The lines in it bothered me and it started to hurt to look at. I got a simple ring that covers it up completely, but I always know it‚Äôs there.

I constantly have the urge to lift the ring and look at it, change the angle of the ring to see the tattoo differently, take the ring off and put it on a different finger and try to feel some sort of balance from looking at the tattoo even though it drives my brain crazy.

I end up spending so much time each day staring at my hands, re-arranging my rings and looking at this tattoo from different angles. It stresses me out, harms my productivity and overall, is a waste of time.

This may be POCD or actual pedophila please please help,"Please please please help

I also posted this in POCD. I‚Äôm new to reddit but I feel like this could help too. Also this may be reassurance seeking. I‚Äôm sorry if it is. 

Okay so this post is long but please read it I‚Äôm struggling so bad so I thank anyone who reads and responds. 
I was recently diagnosed with POCD after holding it in for so long. Tonight I fell down a google rabbit hole and I am not doing so hot. I‚Äôm not really sure if POCD is right. 

A bit of a backstory, I was sexually abused for most of my life. This caused a lot of weird sexual behaviors as a child. I don‚Äôt really count that because I was a child. But as as adult, I started having sexual fantasies that involved kids. These would often get me off. I didn‚Äôt worry about it much. I just chalked it up to the fact that it was probably trauma related because a lot of the thoughts were young girls that resembled my growing up situation. But it started getting worse. I would read stories written by other people about their child fantasies, and this would get me off. A couple of times I found myself checking images which led me to a picture of a kid at a nude beach and one of a toddler ‚Äúhumping‚Äù. I occasionally found myself googling if I was a pedophile and would get upset. But I tried to reassure myself that I‚Äôm very attracted to adults, which I am. Fast forward to college in a human sexuality course. We had to watch a video that literally showed child genitalia for educational purposes. I had to write a paper on it and during research, I stumbled over a video of a naked baby getting a massage, it aroused me. All of these images burned into my mind and were things that would come up during alone time. Again, it would pop in my mind randomly and I would fall down a search of ‚Äúam I a pedophile?‚Äù Fast forward to a bit after that, I was changing a baby and when I was cleaning his parts I moved it around a bit out of curiosity, confusion. It never gave me any sexual gratification, to this day I can‚Äôt think of a time that it crossed my mind during alone time. Most of those thoughts have always been about girls, which I‚Äôve always associated having to do with trauma. I worry about daddy/baby relationships I‚Äôve had and taboo adult porn I‚Äôve watched in the past and if that makes me a pedophile. I have thoughts about hurting my own children that I don‚Äôt even have. I feel like I‚Äôve fucked up big time. 

Okay, now to present time. I had a psychotic break at the beginning of the year and now I am constantly freaking out that I molest children. That I hurt him. I am constantly feeling ‚Äúgut punched‚Äù because of all of the above. I literally get sick with anxiety and passive suicidal thoughts. I haven‚Äôt gone in depth with my therapist because I‚Äôm so scared and shameful. I am constantly worrying about the fact that it never bothered me until now and what that says about me. I feel like I should be locked away, that I am no better than my abuser. But I‚Äôm also too scared to talk about it because I don‚Äôt want to be locked away. My brain constantly has ‚Äúpop in‚Äù memories of all of these things. Over and over and over again. I worry that I‚Äôm feeling guilty for what I‚Äôve done instead of anxious about not doing these things. If that makes sense. Every time I watch porn, I constantly remind myself that they‚Äôre an adult. I avoid every article about about child sex related crimes. But I also continuously worry about the thoughts I have if am going to hurt someone else, if I did hurt the child. I try to reassure myself like ‚ÄúOkay. I am in a relationship with an adult who I‚Äôm attracted to, I don‚Äôt actively think these thoughts when I‚Äôm out in public unless they‚Äôre intrusive. I‚Äôve never tried or wanted to actively groom a child.‚Äù I‚Äôm CONSTANTLY googling if medications will fix pedophilia and researching POCD. No matter how much myself or my partner tries to reassure me that it‚Äôs OCD I feel like I can‚Äôt believe it, or that there‚Äôs more to the story that they don‚Äôt know or that I sugar coat it (which they also know everything above so that‚Äôs not true). Even if I try to tell myself that I can just do better in the future, it doesn‚Äôt ease this awful feeling. I‚Äôm stressed. I feel helpless and alone. I don‚Äôt want this to be how I live forever. Please someone reason with or relate to me. 

Also worth noting, I have other symptoms of OCD like eyelash pulling and this topic causes religious fears that I‚Äôm going to hell because I‚Äôm a child molester and constantly praying and confessing.",OCD,1574749416,thr0waway5610293847,0,1,True,2019-11-26

Would it be over the top to buy plasticware or keep some dishes to myself and wash them myself with my own utensils?

Oddly Happy That I Was Diagnosed,"Hi folks,

I was diagnosed by my psychologist (and then subsequently a GP) about two weeks ago. For years I've had odd symptoms and thoughts that I believed to be normal, or at least manageable. The earliest I recall having symptoms was in the second grade. There were some letters or words that I'd associate emotional and physical responses to. For example, if you think of the capital ""H"", it is really just three lines--two vertical, one horizontal. I liked capital H because I perceived it to be ""balanced"" and ""whole."" There were some letters, however, such as lowercase ""i"" and lowercase ""j"" that really bugged me due to the separation between the ""dots"" and ""lines."" I tried explaining this to my teacher (as best as a second-grader can) but nothing really came of it. In fact, I don't ever recall anyone speaking to me about it ever again.

As the years went on, I started developing ticks. The earliest ticks I had consisted of shaking and seizing, repeating the sound ""eek-ya-boo"" several times (often in response to ""bad"" letters), and picking at my lips. When I was very little, my dad was concerned I had some kind of physical neurological condition, so I was sent for tests at the hospital. One of the tests had me stay overnight with one of those skull caps with the electrodes on them. The tests were inconclusive, and that was that. Looking back at it now, I find it kind of remarkable how all of the medical professionals I encountered never caught onto my OCD. But then again, children are notoriously bad at describing how they feel on a deeper level.

A few years ago (in my early teens) I developed what others seem to call ""Pure-O."" The best way I can describe what was happening to me is that I would place ""bets"" against myself. For example: ""If three cars don't merge in front of you in the next 30 seconds, your friend Johnathan is going to die."" Around the same time, I developed what I now understand to be a ritual. At bed time, I would have to say ""I love you (family member)"" and ""goodnight (family member)"" in a specific way to the photos I had on my dresser. If I made an error, got sidetracked, or another thought intruded this routine, I'd have to start over. I once spent 20+ minutes doing this in one sitting.

Thankfully, I grew out of the ""betting"" behaviors about a year or two ago. But my ticks and anxiety have only been getting worse. The ticks I have right now are blatantly obvious, and I'm almost certain everyone I know has observed them in one way or another. I'd say at least three times a minute, I quickly crank my head and eyes twice to the left, and then ""balance"" it by doing the same thing to the right. I wear glasses, so these behaviors cause a noticeable change in my vision, and it feels ""correct"" if I go from totally blurry to being able to see again. If I look up over my glasses, it's ""neutral"" so no other corrections have to be done. I also have this really gross tick where I'll scratch my head, place my hand under my nose, and quickly inhale whilst looking over my glasses. I can't say I particularly enjoy the smell (lol) but it's just become habitual now. I also have to constantly touch my face and rub my eyes because it constantly feels as though there is something on/in it. One of the most annoying ticks I have is kicking the heels of my shoes, twice on both sides, to ensure my toes won't fall off. I know that they won't, but as I'm sure some of you know, you've just gotta do it ""or else!""

I also feel the need to constantly reassure that my mom still loves me, and that she's doing alright. I'm taking a year off from school and going to college next September, so I'm still living at home for right now. When I'm at work or away, I need to call her at least once because I feel like the police are out to get me (even though I'm a fairly law-abiding person haha), or fear that the house is on fire and she's asleep.

I find it scarily easy to slip into new ticks. I've just developed one literally days ago where I need to swipe my finger/hand over my phone and computer screens. This is rather annoying.

I have general anxiety over whether people like me or not. I don't really care if people I don't know hate me or whatever, but I really care about my coworkers'/friends' perspective on me. I frequently ""Jokingly"" ask if they hate me, but in reality I need the reassurance or else I feel miserable.

A minor ritual/tick I have is checking if things are locked. When I lock my house when I leave, for example, I need to check the door handle multiple times. The same is true in my car--lock the doors, then lock them about 8 more times. (I have similar issues with car windows.)

I've been trying to limit my driving lately because I fear that my ticks are going to get somebody hurt. Although I can remain very focused behind the wheel, sometimes I shoulder check four times before a turn, and that can easily add up to multiple seconds where I'm not looking at the road ahead. Scary.

Anyway, I have been seeing a psychologist for unrelated issues (I lost my father in a familial murder-suicide) for a while now. When I told him about these symptoms, he had me read an article about OCD and I literally nearly checked all the boxes. He told me his thoughts about my potential OCD, and recommended I see a physician. I scheduled an appointment at a walk-in clinic a few days later (my family doctor is always booked weeks ahead) and he prescribed me Zoloft. Now, that's a whole different story (I ended up not taking it because I have this irrational idea that it'll harm me) but I'm seeing my family doctor soon, hopefully to get a referral to a psychiatrist.

Although it's becoming increasingly apparent how OCD has been hijacking my life for almost two decades, it's kind of nice to know what has been going on. I feel relieved because I now understand that all of these terrible symptoms I've described in this post, and all of the ones I haven't (there are probably almost a hundred) are treatable. I understand that my OCD may not ever be cured, but if I can get a hand on my personal life perhaps I can make myself a better person.

If you've made it this far into my post, thank you. Sincerely. I've been wanting to share this for so long now, but I haven't got the courage to explain this to my friends this in depth.

I'm going to talk to my doctor about a potential treatment plan between him and my psychologist (my psych said he'd be up for that) and perhaps I can take the first few steps to getting better.

I look forward to chatting with you and reading your comments!",OCD,1574761482,Terry22334,12,1,True,2019-11-26
"Wanting to get help for (possible) OCD, can you tell me about ERP and other treatments?","Hi there. 

I‚Äôve always had some issues with obsessive thinking (and the compulsions) that followed. I now realize I may have had several different specific obsessions throughout my life. As a child (and still today, in a different house) I would follow a bizarre ritual that involved turning lights on and off and closing doors in a specific order to ward off a demon I believed lived in my closet. A couple years later I made a ‚Äúbargain‚Äù with god during a prayer that if I stopped doing a specific sexual sin, he would let my dog recover from his surgery and live. I sinned, dog died. I believed I was being punished and felt guilty for years. I think I still do tbh- I‚Äôve just never told anyone. Then for a while I was absolutely terrified and simultaneously obsessed with having schizophrenia. I would think myself in and out of panic attacks-constantly dissociated from reality. In the more recent years I started having smaller rituals- checking the oven repeatedly, checking to see if my straightener was turned off, counting my shaving strokes in the shower and needing to reach even numbers, grooming my nails for 5 hours straight, checking if the door was locked by turning the handle 10 times-turning around-repeating, flossing until my gums hurt for weeks, rereading texts and reddit posts hundreds of times over, issues with my weight. I have constant intrusive thoughts- ‚ÄúWhat if I didn‚Äôt lock the door-bear could come in a kill me right now and my cat and my boyfriend would come home to our maimed bodies!!‚Äù And ‚ÄúI could pick my cat up and squish him right now with my bare hands. Wtf, why did I just think that? What the fuck is wrong with me.‚Äù

Tbh, I knew I was having obsessive thoughts and I knew I was engaging in ritualistic behavior, but, I always felt it wasn‚Äôt severe enough to do anything about- until the summer. I started having a spider issue at my house. I‚Äôve always been afraid of spiders but I‚Äôve never had to deal with them so much...I was finding 6+ a day. I found a black widow once and would stay up sometimes just worrying about my cat getting bitten. Anyways- I got bit in the middle of the night by something a couple months ago and it woke me up from dead sleep. Hurt incredibly bad. I spent the next months checking my entire bed (and my 40ish stuffed animals) for spiders. I would lie in bed and if I felt any kind of tickle, turn on a flashlight and inspect. At some point I think I was imagining tickles. I started losing significant sleep and that is when I realized I need help. 

The spiders went away bc it‚Äôs winter, so that‚Äôs over (for now.) But I have a couple questions that maybe someone could help me with:

1: With ERP, would they use this method with spiders? I feel like this literally triggered me to a degree I do not want to go back to. Maybe this is a dumb question, but I‚Äôm honestly terrified that they are going to try and do this. 

2: Secondly, I‚Äôm scared to go on antidepressants. My sister has bi-polar type 2 and I watched her go in and out of mental hospitals my entire childhood. I also watched her react to a lot of drugs- and a lot of those reactions were not good, like really bad, like acted like she was demon possessed bad. I always promised myself I wouldn‚Äôt ever need drugs (ridiculous promise, I know). I was prescribed Zoloft once and it gave me extreme anxiety. I‚Äôm really scared of how they might make me feel. I‚Äôm also scared of the withdrawals. I‚Äôm home alone 3 days and nights out of the week and my anxiety gets bad on those nights. I‚Äôm afraid of having another drug-induced panic attack while I‚Äôm alone and helpless. Maybe some success stories, or descriptions of how you felt when trying them out would be helpful, if you are okay with sharing. 

I think I do need help. Someone asked me if I even knew how much (potential) OCD could be affecting me if I‚Äôve never had it treated. They have a point- I don‚Äôt know. 

TLDR: I pretty confident I have OCD and I would like to seek treatment but am stuck on some concerns I‚Äôve been having and am looking for some encouragement. Questions are above. Thank you!",OCD,1574762244,catmilley,1,1,True,2019-11-26

I have an appointment tomorrow.,"I have an appointment tomorrow with a psychological service. Right now I'm thinking about it and I'm starting to feel I can't breathe. And now I have tears in my eyes. 

I hate OCD. I've had it since I was a child. But wasn't diagnosed til I was around 13. The person who helped diagnosed me, (and who I talked to the most) was amazing. I really clicked with them. But then I turned 18 and could no longer use that service as it was for people under 18. 

At that time. I thought, 'Great! I'm becoming an adult. Everything will get better.' 

I really miss that positivity I had. 

The word adult is a lie. Just because you aged into one. Doesn't mean a switch will flip and you now know all the right choices to make. That you will suddenly have everything under control. Being an adult is just looking like you do. I'm 25 now and have no idea what I'm doing. But one thing I do know is that the feeling of impending doom will always be around. 

My OCD has changed over the years. I have called them phases. 'The world's going to end', 'The devil's going to get you', 'Intrusive sexual thoughts', 'That 1% of germ that the disinfected didn't kill will come for you'. And so many other micro obsessions. 

And up until recently. I thought I knew what my OCD was and what it wasn't. I saw the tree, but didn't realise how deep the roots went. 

And realising how deep and intertwined the roots were in me. I got so angry and then felt so hopeless. It's really not going to go away. 

I only recently found this sub. I don't use Reddit often and before I would never looked up things relating to OCD. I was scared of a new obsession forming. 

But I'm kinda happy I've found this place. I've read some of the things here and thought. 'Wow, that's like me!' and then thought, 'Wow, that's just like me...'. It comforts me to an extent to know that there are people who can truely understand me. But also makes me sad that there are people who go through the same shit I do. We don't deserve this. 

And with the appointment tomorrow. I am scared and worried. I really hope I click with the person I speak too. Or at least feel comfortable and they can help me a bit. I did try to get some help after turning 18 but the person I talked to then wasn't much help. 

And this past year has been rough. My OCD, anxiety, and depression have ran wild. While my confidence and self-esteem have hit the ground. And then there was the whole episode of realising how intertwined my OCD was into my being. 

I really want to keep fighting. But I am so tired. And my OCD is going hardcore with the germ phase. The physical response is strong. If something is contaminated. I can't touch it. If I try to clean it. It's a process. Things get crossed contaminated. And if nothing seems to be working and everything is getting ruined. And I'm just trying to clean desperately. But it all seems hopeless. I have a breakdown. 

But I'm also on the other end. Certain parts of my place is a mess because of depression. But also because I haven't build a good enough plan to clean certain areas perfectly. Or there's too many chances of things going wrong and rising another panic. Or I need to clean this part completely then I can do this part. Sometimes I just want to throw things out. But then thoughts like, 'That's wasteful.', 'Just clean it. It will be fine.' or sentimental value or the fear of actually needing it and not having it may also pop up. And then that whole process overloads me and starts to wear me down. 

And the really sad thing is. That this is my normal. This is the average day. I don't know what life is like without OCD. And I envy what I could have been without it. 


Sorry if this is too long or not appropriate. I just wanted to talk. I've had this written out in my phone all day. 

Also. I apologise for the format or if something is wrong. I only use Reddit on my phone and I don't know all about that stuff.",OCD,1574765368,duckamagpie,0,1,True,2019-11-26

Recently proposed by a psychiatrist that I may have autism. Not sure how to feel,"I just want to first of all clarify that the reason that I don't know how to feel is not because I think having autism is a bad thing - I just don't think that I have it. 

I had an assessment a few weeeks ago to diagnose ADHD - I came back as having enough symptoms to diagnose me with combined ADHD (inattentive + hyperactive), but they couldn't rule out autism as a better explanation, and as such have referred me for a second assessment with an expert in autism. For me, this is frustrating, as I have waited over a year since referral for the ADHD assessment - and I don't think I have autism, at least not to the extent that it would explain the difficulties I had attributed to ADHD. 

The symptoms they listed as suggestive of autism make sense to me; lack of empathy, difficulty reading facial expressions, troubles keeping friends, routines, thinking imaginary play was silly when I was younger.

"Autistic people living in the Midwest, what are your experiences?","I currently live in the Northeastern USA (a NYC suburb), and the Midwest is one of the regions of the county I am considering moving to after I graduate college. I want to be a grad student and work in academia, and I'm extremely averse to white-collar/industry jobs (I'm a physics major). Hence why I'm not too concerned about moving to a poorer region of the country, and why I'm not too interested in living in a higher-paying region of the country. I also find the pace of life here in the Northeast to be too fast-paced for me.

I've been browsing subreddits for various midwestern cities and asking some of my Midwestern friends about the culture in Midwestern cities. And one thing that stands out to me is that people tend to casually chat up strangers in random places: on the bus, in the checkout line, etc. I would imagine that could get awkward for me, as an autistic person who's bad at initiating conversations. However, I also hear that Midwesterners are very hardworking, honest, and down-to-earth and I feel like I would fit into the culture of any decently large Midwestern city (i.e. above 200k people).

I am autistic, Chinese-American, transgender (MtF), and aromantic-asexual. I intend to live single and never get married or have kids or own pets.

Autistic people living in the Midwest, what's it like there? Do you enjoy living there or do you want to move out? Do you feel like you can be your true self in the Midwest, or do you feel like you have to mask all the time?

(Keep in mind I don't want to hear ""muh cornfield"" stereotypes. I've visited a few Midwestern cities and they all felt very un-rural to me. I also define ""Midwest"" somewhat vaguely as stretching from the Great Plains to Western PA and Upstate NY, so if you live in Pittsburgh, Buffalo, etc you're welcome to comment as well.)",autism,1584638718,FemmeboyAmanda,7,1,True,2020-03-19
On modern ABA and being borderline autistic,"I have always been just shy of diagnosable with autism and I've been in therapy since I was 6. I'm 25 now. The therapy I provide is called ABA but it has little in common with old methods. I don't punish. I only provide positive reinforcement and I see my client as a partner even though he's four. I call him my corduroy boy. At the end of the book corduroy the little girl takes the bear home and says ""I like you the way you are but I think you'll be more comfortable with your shoulder strap fastened"" I tell him ""I like you the way you are but I think you'll be happier with the school skills and social skills I'm teaching you"". My best friend is an adult with autism. Sometimes other providers make me so angry! They act like their clients are beneath them because they have autism. They make jokes and compare them to animals. Of course the original science was tested on animals! All science is tested on animals to start with including the basis of the therapy I've been receiving for 20 years! I want to help kids grow up to be able to function in a world that can be cruel the way my therapists have helped me. That's my goal as an ""ABA"" therapist.

"""You're being too _____!"" and other sayings that make me mask around my family.","This is just a bit of a rant. 

Ever since I was a little kid I can remember being told, specifically by my mother, that I was always being ""too much"" of something. When I get excited I tend to clap my hands and get louder, when I'm upset or nervous about something my voice gets louder, when I'm sad or frustrated I tend to have meltdowns and cry about nothing sometimes and what is a lot sometimes.

""You're being too freaking loud! I'm standing right here!""

""Lower your freaking voice. I can hear you.""

""Look at you! You're being too emotional there's nothing to cry about!""

You're being too loud has been a constant in my life from her, and to an extent my step-dad. But he knows better after I snapped and said, *""THIS IS MY HOUSE TOO. I LIVE HERE TOO WHY CAN'T I BE LOUD. YOU COMPLAIN WHEN I'M QUIET AND YOU GET UPSET WHEN I GET LOUD.""* 

Today's reason my mother got upset with me for being loud? I got loud because I found out a guest I spoke to and came into contact with at a wedding earlier this month has tested positive for COVID-19.

I didn't realize my voice was getting louder, but the instant she told me, ""Lower your freaking voice."" I instantly became aware that my natural reactions to things were to be hidden. It's something that reminds me that I have to keep masking, even around my own mother. 

We are together at home until April 6th. I was reminded why I need to stay out of her way and not speak too much.",autism,1584646245,oatmilkfreesthecows,4,1,True,2020-03-19

Types of schooling on the spectrum,"Hello everyone! This is my first time posting anything. I'm not on the spectrum, but my little brother is and his experience in the public school system led me to majoring in Early Childhood Special Education. I hope to make school a better place for those both neurodivergent and neurotypical. One of my assignments is a research paper. I'm looking into the differences between mainstream classrooms and classrooms or schools made specifically for those with autism or varying disabilities. I'd love to hear firsthand experiences of what school was like for you. Some questions I have are: 

What kind of school did you go to? (Mainstream, special ed, homeschool, some combination) 

What was your relationship like with your teachers?

Did you have a para educator with you? If yes, how did they change the classroom environment for you? 

What was your relationship like with your peers? 

If you were in mainstream, did you feel included? 

What could have made school better for you? 

Anything else you'd like to share? 

I want to be the best teacher I can be, and I truly believe that communication and an understanding of what it's like for the children is important and my brother is no help.

Advice,"Hey all,

My girlfriend has high functioning ASD. She's such an awesome person-funny, smart, animated. But she struggles with making and keeping friends. She said today that she sees a lot of posts from people being sad about not being able to see her friends in person- and she doesn't even have any friends to miss. That broke my heart. 

 I was wondering there are any other ASD friends who would like to chat online, or had recommendations for how to do so.  She enjoys playing on her PlayStation, Switch, Stardew Valley, Fornite, and Minecraft. She loves dinosaurs and sharks. She loves all animals. She loves movies. Her special interests include planes, plane-spotting, YouTube and sometimes trains. She likes Last Podcast on the Left.

She'd be interested in finding other ASD/aspie friends to play with on PlayStation, online games, or have a netflix watch party. A netfllix watch party is when you can watch a movie at the same time and type-chat to each other. She's super chill and funny. If you want to chat with her, get to know her, or have are interested in making more friends and acquaintances, please feel free to comment and reach out. Does anyone have any advice on how to make and keep friends as an aspie during this time of social distancing?

"What is a good way to react react to ""Well, you don't 'seem' autistic!"" (With rant)","I get it that when people tell me and my sibling this, they mean it as a compliment. I don't want to be the person who immediately rounds on someone who just means well, but it makes me want to ask: ""Why is that a compliment? Why does coming off as autistic or neurodivergent in any way have to be so unwanted?"" 

I know why *I* did my best to seem as neurotypical as possible: it's a defense mechanism. The more neurotypical I behave, the better treated I am by other people. I don't want it to be this way - I've been struggling for years just to accept myself as an autistic person. 

As a kid, my first experience with Autism as a term was meeting my piano teacher's son when my mom decided to give him a dvd. I was frustrated that he would continually hit the back button to watch a specific thing (which I do now, how hypocritical of me) and that he ""would not talk to me"". My mom later explained to me that he had ""Autism"". Now, I don't remember exactly what she said, so I can't completely blame her, but she did specify that people with autism often wore adult diapers, so that's what I associated with it. *How horrible it must be to have Autism!* I thought. When I was diagnosed, it was with Asperger's syndrome, so I unconsciously thought that I was still different, just slightly weird. 

In 6th grade, we had to read a book about a boy with what the DSM would now call ""low-functioning"" Autism. At the time, the DSM still categorized Asperger's as it's own thing, so I still didn't consider myself Autistic. The book described what I took as a highly intelligent person, trapped in a body that couldn't communicate. I remember it featuring some kind of technological touchpad to help him communicate. They would hold his hand and 'guide' it to the pad. In all seriousness, I give this book credit for speaking out against the abuse that special ed students go through, and my problem is mainly the way that my school presented it all. It fit into my pre-existing view that this was ""the"" way Autism expressed - and that it was a tragedy to have. I thought to myself: *Man, it must be horrible to have Autism!* 

Interestingly enough, this before 2013, so I must have been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome only a few years before its removal from the DSM. I only found out years later, and that's probably when the realization set in, that I was, by definition, Autistic. 

This horrible disorder that at best makes you a loser, and at worst a diaper-wearing burden? (I realize now just how harmful this view of low-functioning Autistic people is, but I do have to acknowledge what I was taught for most of my life.) I was one of them?

When I stopped using ""Aspie"", and moved towards ""high-functioning Autistic"" (I didn't want to sound unscientific), I remember it stinging inside. It didn't matter that I didn't wear a diaper and could take care of myself, I was still *Autistic*. 

Since then, I've made a lot of progress in getting more comfortable with the label and educating myself on the spectrum. I asked myself why it was such a hard thing for me to call myself, which was when I had to confront the image of low-functioning Autistics I had and am now working to correct it. I'm even working on embracing my identity as an Autistic person. It's still in progress, since being weird has always brought me trouble. 

I'm so sorry how much of a rant/story of my life this turned into, it's just that I know how it feels to pity people with autism, but not actually accept them.

I have difficulty approaching this sort of thing without it sounding accusatory, so for now I've just brushed it off and insisted that I was. Is there a way to gently make people critically analyze how they view autistics?",autism,1584699647,Cardimis,4,1,True,2020-03-20
"Managing multiple thoughts,, feelings &amp; tasks","i am undiagnosed but fairly confident that i am on the spectrum. i‚Äôm a 25 year old male, work 2 full time jobs out of necessity and am beyond overwhelmed.. both of my jobs are ‚Äúsimple‚Äù and extremely easy for me. they are also minimum wage each (washington state $13.50)
i love one of them and will continue to work there for as long as possible and the other i have been wanting to leave for a while as they don‚Äôt treat me well and the company doesn‚Äôt seem like they care about us at all (very small business). my day job i have to drive an hour to get to so that‚Äôs 2 hours everyday that i lose but can possibly listen to books during that time.

my schedule is is basically 9-5 at my day job with an hour or so driving each way then i work nights starting at 7pm until we are done,, 12am-5am and this job is super close to home for me so no lost time there. 

i haven‚Äôt always worked this much,, i used to make a wage at one job about double what i am now but i absolutely hated the industry i was in. i did construction and while i absolutely loved building,, the people in it that i kept encountering were absolutely terrible. i couldn‚Äôt handle how i was being treated so i went to my next best option experience wise



any helpful tips on how i can try to become more accomplished throughout the day? 
i just need to be able to get one or two tasks done per day in between work and then hopefully more on my one day off!

i really struggle with managing daily tasks. a good example would be that my fianc√©e and i moved into our apartment and still haven‚Äôt fully ‚Äúmoved‚Äù in.. we both struggle with our mental health although my fianc√©e doesn‚Äôt experience ASD symptoms,, they have their own things going on

also how can i process things better? 
like if i need to do something,, what‚Äôs a good way to remember? 
i have tried notes on my phone but i won‚Äôt look at them and it‚Äôs not a conscious choice to not look at them.  i also forget extremely easy and pretty much everything i need to do,, unless at work i know my jobs very well and am extremely meticulous about them. probably doesn‚Äôt help that the job i love also has to do with one of my special interests

how do you process emotions?
i don‚Äôt understand my fianc√©es emotions at all let alone my own. i understand when she is happy,, mad or sad if it‚Äôs to the extreme but other than that i am pretty much blind to emotions. i very very rarely ever emote and if i do its to a emotional part in a kids movie. movies are the only thing that can make me cry happy or sad tears without a doubt very time and i don‚Äôt get it. good example would be when i lost both my grandfathers in middle/high school,, i didn‚Äôt cry i wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúsad‚Äù in the sense that other people are. yea i was and still am sad that i lost them but it doesn‚Äôt and hasn‚Äôt ever effected me to the degree that it does for other people

&amp;#x200B;

 I hope this is an acceptable post for this community.

A while ago a book appeared on the Dutch market called ""Maar je ziet er helemaal niet autistisch uit"" - ""But you don't look autistic at all"". It is written by an autistic woman, and from the cover text it looked like I could learn from it about how autism affects the daily life. My wife is diagnosed with autism, and getting good descriptions of first-hand experiences is really important for me.

In summary: We both loved it, and found it extremely helpful to refer the book to Dutch-speaking co-workers etc. Unfortunately ... Dutch -- not the most well-known language in the world. :)

"My girlfriend is autistic, and she sometimes very mean or hurtful things and she says that she's just blunt/ brutally honest","So pretty much the title, my girlfriend of almost 2 years now was diagnosed last year with autism level 1, OCD, anxiety, and depression. I love her so much we have so many animals together and a great life. We talk alot about stuff and we can for the most part be honest with eachother but sometimes she will say things. I was writing down things in a diary that she said that hurt my feelings but when I told her I had the diary she got very upset that I wrote down quotes of things she has said to me that hurt my feelings.

Ever since her diagnosis I've tried to be nothing but supportive and helpful to her and understanding with any issues she has, but she will sometimes say that it's the way she thinks sometimes and she can't help it when she freaks out. But idk even where I'm really going with this, I tell her that I am patient with her and I will always take what she says into account and do my best to be better or change alittle to be better for her and sometimes I'll ask her to stop certain things or say certain things to help me out. And the other day she told me it's not the autistic person job, it's other people's job to be patient and ask them what they meant by things.

If anyone has seen atypical or the good doctor she has referenced those shows saying like ""people in these shows are patient and understanding when they have breakdowns or can't understand something like other people can. And I understand what she means by that but everyone can change and be better and stop certain things. Idk if anyone read this thank you I'm just looking for maybe incite or opinions on the situation now real advice if you don't want to I'm look for wisdom too maybe to be better for her because we have talked about it multiple times in the last year and she still says things like ""it's gonna take a long time for me to change"" but me being undiagnosed but most likely being on the bipolar spectrum (maybe even BPD) it feels like she wants me to change who I am to help her but she isn't willing to try and change to help me. I may be wrong and out of line I'm sorry. Thank you I gotta go to work now any opinions will be read and any advice will be taken into account.

"Why do I seem to always have to do the 'right' thing, no matter what it costs me ?","Today I lost my last friend, someone i have known for twenty years. Would you mind if I told you about it ?

Why...

Because she told me about someone I also know and how her house was extremely dirty. Think rotting food everywhere piles of stuff and garbage on the floors, a child's bedroom so full of dirty clothes and all the other stuff I've mentioned you could hardly get in and the bed found under this stuff turned out to be a baby bed. The child is no baby anymore and apparently had to sleep in the same bed as its parents. The room for the other child almost as bad but did have a proper bed, with nice large shards of glass under it.  


She told me that when they were on vacation another friend was asked to take care of the cats.  
She called her to come over to the horror show she found in the house, she had to see that for herself. After seeing that she called her parents and talked to them about it. Apparently nobody ever came over and saw what was happening. Also a neighbour had come when they were there and complained and said they would scream at the children a lot.  


My friend and a group of other friends of her decided to help and clean the house. Very admirable, great of them to help. So I asked what happened  when they came home. According to my friend they were not happy, and were complaining they could not find their stuff anymore. Always nice to have grateful friends isn't it.  So I asked who is making sure this would not happen again ? Unfortunately the answer was nobody. When I asked why not she said she did not think it was her place to judge them. 

So what about the kids, they do not deserve to live in a neglected house, it is dangerous for them? My friend was more concerned about any blowback towards her and they would be fine... Really, how do you know? She did not know, but wasn't going to do anything either.

This is where  I come into the story. I grew up in a very abusive family, so there is no way I am not going to make sure this family will get some help and be checked on the welfare of the children. So I told my friend I would do what she would not and inform the agency that helps families like this. just to check how things are now. They come a few times, check  how everybody is doing and making sure everything is clean and all are healthy. If there are no problems for a time (don't know how long) they would simply stop checking, and if there are the'll help them get it under control. So nobody is coming to take the kids from their home as long as everybody does what they are supposed to. And yes, this is really how it works. No need for panic.  


But she said 'she did not want me to do that, and if I did I did not respect her decision, and that she would no longer be my friend'. I tried to convince her that  someone had to check, and if nobody  wanted to do it from their group I had no choice in the matter. 

But no matter how much I talked to her, try to explain why, she was afraid to what might happen to her friendship with her. So her ultimatum was do what I want you to do or you'll never see me again.

I told her you know me, I am the guy that lost his last friend, a former work colleague because I refused to let people drive home from his house after they drunk a lot of alcohol. I'm the guy who jumps in when he sees a group of people attacking an individual, The guy who sends people away when they park on a handicap parking space when they are not allowed to do so. I am always the guy who takes on injustice, not because I want to be a hero of some kind, but I just can't seem to keep my mouth shut and do nothing. She knows this very well, she has see me do just what I described, and also always the one who says I should not interfere, it might be dangerous. Which I know full well, and also paid the price more than once for being me. But I am me, probably will always be me, and to be honest I want to be me, I do not want to stand aside and let things just happen.

So, tonight I've send her a long text trying once again to explain that this is not an attack on her, it is not me choosing something over her. It is me doing what my body and brain scream at me must be done. I desperately hope she will understand, even if that takes time, and even if it will cost me my last friend. But surely hope it doesn't.  


Tell me, am I just a glutton for punishment, or is this something stemming from my autism. Or maybe I am just a fool who can't seem to bud out of other people's business.

2/3 of my workplace was just made redundant and I don't know how to cope. Long post.,"Hey Guys,

I am just posting this because I am currently going through a bit of a rough patch after two thirds (35 out of 50) of my workplace was just made redundant including the work mates which I would always confide in and would support me during time when I am overwhelmed and on the brink of a melt down and I don't know what to do.

For a bit of context, I am a 21 year old austistic male who lives in Australia who for the past 9 months has been pursuing work relating to my special interest (commercial aviation) as a customer service agent for a major international airline here in Australia (The way I got this job is a long story in itself and will be posted another day), now as you guys probably know more than anyone, a position as a customer service agent in the airline industry is not the ideal job for an autistic individual and because of that I have the habit of masking to the point where while I can function incredibly well at work (infact was promoted to be a business lounge supervisor due to my customer service skills after just 3 months of me working there) I have very little energy outside of work and while I am at work I am very much on the edge constantly as I no longer have energy to put towards dealing with sensory overload and sudden changes in routine. Due to this I have confided in a couple of work mates who know me well and know about my condition and go out of their way to make sure I am comfortable and assist me when they notice I am becoming overwhelmed as a way to function properly. 

This system has worked very well for the past 7 months. I have a code word I can tell my manager when I am becoming overwhelemd (in the lounge I am often alone so it is sometimes told over the phone) and when I say it they will send a staff member up to assist me or take over while I calm down, and when I am obviously on the brink of melt down they allow me and one of my work mates to go on an unofficial break to talk it out until I am good to start work again (honestly I cant fault my workplace they have been great in accommodating my needs). 

Anyway, as you should know we are currently in the middle of a pandemic with the caronavirus and one of the worst hit industry's is the aviation industry and as a result alot of airlines including mine has been required to make drastic cost reductions in order to stay afloat in a time where profits are few and far between. In my companies case this involved  laying off approximately 2 thirds of the workforce who are deemed non essential. Now as I said earlier when I am functioning I am very good at what I do, infact I have gotten more written compliments in regards to my service in my 9 months working there than anyone else has gotten combined , and as a result despite me being very new in the scheme of things. The company deemed me essential to keep at work (though be it with lessened hours) which I am happy about however all but one of my work mates who I confided in, in regards to my struggles were unfortunately laid off and the one who survived is being moved to another area which means I will rarely interact with them. 

With that in mind, ever since finding this out I have been terrified about going back to work. Without my workmates I  don't know how I will be able to function as they have always been there when I need it and especially now when alot of guests are agitated and on edge. I am scared that I will not function to an adequate standard and get fired and what not.

So while I can imagine this is a very unique situation for me to be in, do any of you guys have any advice. I need to work something out soon. Thanks.",autism,1584801145,Bolticus13,2,1,True,2020-03-21

How do you survive quarantine/lockdown/social distancing?,"My university just announced they will be online for the rest of the semester, meaning that I'll have no contact with classmates until at the very least June, when we have exams.

This quarantine has made me realise I'm an extravert,"Hi, 21 M and Irish here. My whole life, I always identified as an introvert. That was one of the pillars of my sense of self. I was the quiet one who liked to stay home and keep to himself. 

Only now I'm realising, that isn't actually the case, and it hasn't been for a while. 

Over time I went from being socially terrified introvert to social butterfly, who loved going out and drinking and chatting to people in clubs and bars, who craved big gatherings with new people. 

Man, when the hell did that happen? I'm autistic, it's not supposed to be this way. Honestly, I think I've rejected this extraversion for a long while because it made me feel like I ""wasn't autistic enough"". 

But this damnable quarantine has forced me to really face facts: I love socialising, I love high-stimulation environments, I love going out and meeting folks, and I love getting energy from meeting new people. What a weird development. 

I miss my friend. I'm lonely. And I'm an extravert. 

As an autist this is really weird to admit. But it's good too - it means I'm my own person, free from pre-conceived steretypes.

I don‚Äôt think I am going to make it,"My life feels like it‚Äôs stuck in a trench full of mud, I am learning Russian, my parents are saving up money for Russia, but I went through a major event in my life that made me feel down about life, me staying loyal to my long distance girlfriend from Russia.

I got carried away so when I started the relationship, I had a hard time communicating because of the language barrier, but I made up for it by learning a lot of the language and it‚Äôs pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary in 9 months, however, despite my hard work, my relationship ended, we autistic people are loyal, so that hurt me.

I am searching for another long distance relationship, I feel so alone trying to fit into another culture, I also have my Instagram and VK immersed into Russian and have struggle fitting in there as well, I feel it‚Äôs hard for me because I have autism, socialization is hard, and that makes it especially hard to fit in, especially if it‚Äôs a culture not yours.

My mom is Mexican and my dad is American, but my moms family I feel most connected to, her grandma successfully married her father because he spoke Spanish to her and she did not know English, that is why my moms family is big and I am proud of having her family with me.

I feel I do want to learn Russian, but I feel very alone and upset my future could be in danger if I don‚Äôt work hard enough or my fears get the best of me, I also feel scared because I feel relationships kind of keep that support for me and to not feel alone, I fear that fitting in is too hard without a person by my side.

I really do hope I find a perfect long distance relationship one day so I can fit in, I know it‚Äôs hard but there is no better option because I know I will be alone as socialization is too hard, I know I have support from my family but fitting in is too hard, I feel I need someone for that and that is why I like relationships.

I hope this quarantine thing in the world ends and I happily be able to find someone to live with and love forever, I want to be supported, I want to not feel my life is stuck in a trench, I want to get on top of it and escape into a happier life, I really hope this happens, I don‚Äôt want my future to be doomed.",autism,1584844997,Matvei-behnke,1,1,True,2020-03-21

In need of serious advice...,"I need some serious advice. A friend of mine says he is autistic, I believe him (kinda) when he says he has it but the issue is how he treats me. He's 23 years old and still does things that a child would do and tries to force me to do them back to him(like poke him in the arm or something). He says he enjoys doing said things and they're important to him but the thing is he tries to force me to behave the way he does and I do not have autism. He refuses to take my answers seriously and will have tantrums unless he gets his way, which I don't give in and it ends with him crying and acting like a little kid, trying to guilt trip and manipulate me to get his way. Point blank, all he cares about is what he wants and does not care how the other person feels at all. I feel like he thinks I'm his slave and what he says goes, that is legit how he treats me and I'm older than him by 10 years. I have never in my life had a friend behave this way to the point I want to end the friendship every single day because it's just one thing after the other with him, and he tries to dictate what I say and do and refuses to accept how I am myself as a person. All in all we fight every day because he wants me to act and say certain stuff and I refuse to because I have free will, something he loves to fight with me on. Legit he acts like he owns me and doesn't care at all how negatively he effects me. I just don't know what to do anymore. He's really toxic for my mental health and every time I threaten to end the friendship, he threatens to kill himself. I'm in over my head with this friendship, my question is how do I make this horrible friendship better (if it can be saved), and are there other cases of autism that has been similar to this one?",autism,1584845488,KaoriiiChan,7,1,True,2020-03-21
i‚Äôm scared my therapist won‚Äôt believe me,"about six months ago, i realized i am (most likely) autistic. i‚Äôm 18 and a female with an array of diagnoses, such as depression and ADHD. i have many mental healthcare providers. the problem is, i‚Äôm too afraid to bring it up. online self-diagnoses are definitely questionable, but i have been in the mental health circle for years, and i know my way around this stuff. i have been doing research for months and months on autistic traits in women, and even though it is online, the stories are from real people with real experiences as someone with asd. 

i am realizing more and more how hard i‚Äôve been working all my life to mask. it is now at a point where even the idea of going out is enough to exhaust me. (luckily i‚Äôm in quarantine???) i have lost all sense of what is truly me and what is my habitual masking. my therapists don‚Äôt see that- they just see the depression or anxiety symptoms or something else... idk. i‚Äôm very aware of what my therapists and psychiatrists allude to when asking diagnostic questions. this makes me worried that, if i am screened, i will overthink and manipulate my answers in the way that fits the criteria for autism. 

i‚Äôm often told i‚Äôm not autistic because i don‚Äôt have trouble socializing. i try to explain that i DO and that there are so many other factors involved. unfortunately, i feel like i‚Äôm seen as a fraud trying to convince myself of what isn‚Äôt really there. i‚Äôm in this constant dilemma: either i address it to my current therapist and risk being told the same old crap, or i don‚Äôt bring it up and continue undiagnosed and alone for way longer than needed. 

is there any advice y‚Äôall have on how to address this?

I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm on the spectrum anymore,"I was diagnosed at three with Aspergers. It‚Äôs been a struggle to cope with it and I‚Äôve been bullied in the past for being socially weird. I use to take everything literally, sounds would be overwhelming, and making friends was hard. I also have misophonia, which is the dislikes towards certain sounds. I bring that up, because I started to notice I had misophonia in the fourth grade, and then it got worse in the fifth grade. By the sixth grade, I was having sensory overloads all the time and crying everyday. I also had a new thing where certain visual movements were triggering too.

This all changed by the seventh grade. My team to help me at my school aloud me to use Bluetooth headphones in class and whenever I was dealing with a sound I didn‚Äôt like, I would play music. It wasn‚Äôt perfect, I couldn‚Äôt hear the teacher sometimes, but I could stay in the classroom. 

Now, not only this was the start of my love toward music, but over the years my triggers would weaken over time. By now, as a sophomore, I have two groups of friends, (three, if you count online.) I stopped taking classes on how to socialize a couple of months ago, (provided by my school when I had them.) and I mostly don‚Äôt wear headphones in class anymore, because my triggers have weakened so much. It‚Äôs honestly a blessing. I don‚Äôt recognize the me back from middle school. And sure, I still show quirks here and there from time to time, but new people now won‚Äôt recognize if there‚Äôs something off with me now. It feels like I‚Äôve been cured from ASD!

I have a theory, if you are still reading. At the beginning of the seventh grade, when I got my headphones, I would listen to music for most of the time in school, so practically five or six hours a day, maybe even more if you included the time after school. Could I have been slowly ‚Äúhealing‚Äù my brain with music? Probably not, but it‚Äôs awfully convenient how I started improving socially and sensory wise when I started using Bluetooth headphones. Someone needs to look into it and see if we can help people like me. I‚Äôve looked into it my self and there are some music therapy for people with misophonia.

There are times where someone is talking to me and I legit don‚Äôt want to speak.

As for obsessive interests ima need a clarification on that part, I have no idea how to answer that. So each delay was deff a thing for me, I started talking at the age of 4. I can‚Äôt pay attention for shit although i think my therapist said it‚Äôs mainly dissociation but Idk but my memory is trash.

Confused and Lost with my 5-year-old autistic brother. Parents influence?,"*Hello all, I'm very confused about life right now regarding my brother and mainly confused* ***if parents can influence their child in a negative way****. I don't want to make this a long post but It probably will be. Please read it and stick around because I honestly have nobody else to take advice from.* ***Questions will be bolded throughout the post, with background info before it.***

PSA: Just want the best for my brother, don't want attention or anything, if I offend someone I'm sorry and I will try to remove what has offended you.

# My brother:

He is 5 years old now, he was diagnosed when he was 2 years old. He had physical delays(walking) and eating difficulties. After he turned 5 he started eating whole foods which was good. He is in kindergarten- in the special needs program -and just transferred schools because my parents thought the old school *""wasn't doing enough"".* At home, my brother is on his iPad for the majority of the day         
(6-8 hours). **Is it bad that my brother is on his Ipad the majority of the day? I feel like this is negatively impacting his social skills.** To add on, I don't know if he is verbal or not. He just says things like "" dinner time mama"" or ""shower mama"", ""turn the lights off mama"". My mom taught him how to say these things by repeating them over and over again but he only knows what my mom taught him. He can't create new phrases. Even when is talking to me and my dad he says ""mama"" in the end because he was taught the phrase like that.

# Me:

I'm a 17-year-old, high school senior who is going to college next year. 

# How my parents raised me: ( Worried if the same approach is wrong with my brother)

This post isn't about me but I feel like this is important. Unfortunately, the way my parents raised me was not the best in my opinion. In school when I didn't do so well they would hit me, they would never ground me. In their culture violence shapes a person. Well, they believe this worked because I turned out to be a straight-A student, scholarships blah blah blah ( I'm Asian btw). And my main concern is that my parents are using this same approach with my brother. I know I shouldn't say this online but I have nowhere else to lol. 

# Mom:

My brother is around my mom 24/7. She is the one mainly looking after him since I go to school and my father is at work. BTW my parents are immigrants and have never gone to college. Because of how I was raised, I genuinely hate my toxic mom but I'm just trying to get through this. At home when my brother is on his Ipad, 95 percent of the time she is just chilling and doing housework and the other 5 percent of the time she is feeding him, or taking him to the park. I feel like because my brother is on his Ipad and he isn't bothering my mom she doesn't do anything like make eye contact with him or do anything to try and help socialize with him or with others. My mom doesn't abuse my brother but once a while she will spank him when he isn't listening or when he cries a lot. And for a while when he is crying he will actually hit himself. **Do you think that my brother is hitting himself because my mom is?** Then when he does hit himself they scream at him "" STOP HITTING YOURSELF"". To add on, when he is crying a lot she hits him and screams "" STOP CRYING"". She used to do this often but it stopped for a while until today. He sleeps with my mom and dad and at 7 am this morning started crying a lot. My mom picks him up takes him to the living room and hits him while screaming ""STOP CRYING"". Now the problem is I don't know if its a meltdown or tantrum or just a small episode. **Does my mom hitting my brother while he is crying going to impact him in the future? I read that when an autistic person has a meltdown or is crying you need to comfort them but my mom hits them.** If it was me, and my mom was hitting me, I would stop but I feel like my brother doesn't understand and can't cope with his emotions and meltdown and on top of that my mom hits him wow. She used to hit him often before I called her out so today was the first time in a few months she hit him. Now I know I blame my mother for not helping my brother at home but I also can't help him because I'm busy with school. **Will my mom doing things at home help him? When I mean things I mean like something that will help him socialize.I feel like how my brother will be in the future greatly depends on what he does at home and not just school.**

# Dad:

My dad is usually at work and doesn't take care of my brother that often but when he does its bad. Now my dad is not as bad as my mom. He doesn't hit my brother but he does have anger issues. When my brother doesn't cooperate my dad screams at him like he is fighting another grown man. Then later apologizes and baby talks to my brother. BTW: Both my parents apologize later after screaming or hitting him, like a cycle, and do it again another time. **Does screaming and yelling at my brother help? Or does it impact him negatively?**

# Thank you:

Thanks for reading all of this. I will be posting more questions since I don't know anything on the top of my head. This was very hard to write, I cried many times. Please help me and comment advice

Should I consider having high-functioning autism as a disability?,"I'm filling out a *job application and it ask me to check all that apply, one of them being ""I have a disability"". I've filled out this application several times and I always get stuck on this.

I am hesitant because if I do so, people might infantilize me. But I'm hesitating to do so because maybe it'll help people understand and make the experience more comfortable‚Äîbut I also don't want them to know that there's something to understand, so they don't treat me different, or think I'm not capable‚Äîalthough they might treat me like everyone else, I doubt they will.

What should I do? It's not like my autism is that noticable, most people just think I'm an odd-ball, but if you payed close attention you could probably tell :/

I really want to finish this application and this is the one thing stopping.

"Weird question, oof","So, this is going to be a weird question, lol. I need a but of advice. I've always been really annoyed by inaccuracies in shows, games etc. Currently I'm very obsessed with history (mostly ww2) and crime scene investigation stuff (I cannot give an explanation to why as I don't even know myself XD)

So, my question is, how do I stop being so frustrated by even minor inaccuracies?? It's at the point where people don't even want to watch/talk about shows about the topics with me because I ""suck the joy out of everything"" XD (There's so much joy to be had with a severed arm, KAREN)
I can't help it, and I bet it annoys me more than them, I know not everything is meant to be taken seriously and alot of shows specifically are meant for the entertainment value.

Also, there's the whole worry of the inaccuracies I'm missing (yes that is an actual thing I experience) it leads to frantically trying to fill up the gaps and constantly over analysing whatever im watching. Let's just say it takes the entertainment value out of most shows.

This problem is seriously limiting what I can watch, like I've been forced to throw most crime/historical dramas out of the windowü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Dwight Schurte and Autism," I have been thinking about portrayals of autism/aspergers in the media recently. This is important because to a lot of neurotypicals; this is their only or main exposure to the spectrum. There has been discussion on Rain Man, Sheldon, and cute autism, but I wanted to talk about Dwight.

I am not a fan of the Office. I decided to give it another try recently since it is the internet's favorite show, and it is quoted so frequently at my work. It was fine. Not great and not bad. One thing that struck me was how Dwight clearly had a version of Hollywood Autism. Not cute autism, but a version of autism that is permeated by writers who don't want to do that much research nonetheless. 

Dwight has a narrow set of interests (Beets, Bears, and Battlestar Galactica), monotonous speech, and poor social interactions. The one part that stuck with me most of all is how he was treated by the show and the other characters [This post on cute autism] (https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/d5othz/cute_autism_a_redditors_comment_on_sheldon_cooper/) does accurately explain the flaws with it (using Sheldon as an example). Dwight, on the other hand, is repeatedly shown as a nuisance who regularly takes jokes too far. Arguably the most famous cold open in the show's history (the fire drill) is the result of a prank. Mike and his coworkers regularly get frustrated with his behavior. In a way, this could be seen as an improvement over cute autism since it shows that autism isn't always good and sometimes has consequences.

However, on the other hand, it shows Jim repeatedly humiliating him, and Jim is lionized for it. Other characters mock and ridicule Dwight for his behavior. The trade-off for showing downsides to autism is normalizing the idea that demeaning autistic people is acceptable. Autistic people will cause trouble in your life so mock away.

I would like to repeat that I am not an Office fan so if a fan of the Office disagrees please comment. To bring in an anecdotal experience, I have been compared to Sheldon, Dwight, and recently Shaun Murphy (the Good Doctor). In my experience, the people who brought up Dwight were usually mocking me the most. Sheldon is the middle ground between frustration and understanding. Shaun was a more misguided attempt to uplift me. (I do not know anything about the Good Doctor so I am unaware of how flawed it could be)

Also, if you have characters who you feel represent your experiences the best, please share them.",autism,1585012379,VHalliewell,10,1,True,2020-03-23

         My answer is""very difficult"",Somebody think the autism is differented to other people. But our needs are simple.We just need some place to get alone. need a place to do anything.We can just think about the time of elevator  from first floor to fifth floor or the the footsteps of ours.

          Some story of Me, I born in Hong Kong.And I follow my brother to a nice primary school. But it's the beginning of the nightmare.
          
          In the beginning of class 5, Because of my grade of English and chinese.I start to bully by my classmates and class teacher. They punish me and push me. Some even hit me and write ""idiot"" in my school bag.
I finally enroll the a Secondary school.(I am still learning in the school)

          At my 6 years in primary school. I bullied by teacher and classmates.
I won't trust anyone including teacher and classmates. In the first two years of Secondary school. No one know I am autistic. In this year, i am from 3. And my class is the best grade class in form 3. The teachers stricte to me. I feel extremely stressed. But i have better iq than others.
So it's fine for me.

            My families always hit me and bullied me for so many years. I adapt this environment and I can alone for a long time. Many people talked me and I can't look to their eyes because I afraid of everyone such like my class teacher. 

                   ""I can't be a normal, but I will pretend as much as possible.""

Autistic pokemon team,"Sorry for the weirdness. I'm already done with all my classes for the week and my dorm is being quarantined so I'm slowly going crazy. I decided to make the most autistic pokemon team ever. 

\----------------------------------

Mimikyu: the ""face"" of autistic pokemon since it literally masks. If you aren't a fan of pokemon and are still reading, it disguises itself as pikachu so people will like it more. 

&amp;#x200B;

Clefable: sensitive hearing and so it's rarely seen. Nuff said.

&amp;#x200B;

Alolan Ninetales: It lives on the top of snowy mountains. If it finds out anyone is trapped on the mountain, it will lead them down. This isn't due to it being nice, it just wants to be alone (the pokedex entry is: ""The reason it guides people all the way down to the mountain‚Äôs base is that it wants them to hurry up and leave"").

&amp;#x200B;

Quagsire: I just put it here since it is extremely clumsy. The pokedex entry says it swims into boats by accident regularly.

&amp;#x200B;

Goodra: One pokedex entry says it always misunderstands things. I think most of us can relate to this.

&amp;#x200B;

Lopunny: This one is a little weird, so hang with me. Lopunny doesn't like hard touches. If anyone touches it roughly, it kicks them. I personally don't like soft touches, but I've read some autistics don't like hard touches so I put Lopunny on the team.

How does criminal justice deal with autistic criminal?,"A 29 years old had been hating the mainstream society as hatred. He hate them really much that he wod go and attemp to kill them. But in the past, he has lots of history of bullying and abuse (especially by his therapist). He was forced to adapt the mainstream enviroment and the social norm so he was forced to not to carry dolls in the public as he was a teenager back then, he was force to join  youth club for his age which he really hated but wasnt allow to play with his younger friends around his neighbour area based in his late adolescent. So now, he has hatred towards the mainstream society that he could beat up people with severely injuries whenever he felt threatened. He once had murdered a 5 years old girl and a 12 years old boy after he heard voice in his head that he is not to out play with his younger friends because he should move on. Whenever he heard he should move forward and not to be the same or thats the way the society is, he would bang people head against the wall until the person died. In this situation, how does criminal justice deal with this case. This young man has severe trauma and depression. Like sending him to prison wouldnt be fair for him eventhought he is an adult as base on what he is going through. So how does criminal justice deal with this situation?",autism,1585061993,Adrianzijunluk,11,1,True,2020-03-24

I think i could be autistic and this confuses me,"Hello Lifeforms,

i had a mental breakdown a few weeks ago and try to prevent this in the future because this was not fhe first of this kind. Since this really want to work on myself. I am MTF Transgender and read something about Transgender tend to have a higher chance of beeing autistic. I had to admit it never really was a topic for me. I met several People in LGBT-Youth Clubs who happen to also be autistic.

Now i read so much stuff about autistic people and it hit me like a Truck. I have the same feeling again when i discovered Transgender-Transition. It all feels so fitting, but i have so much confusion and doubt. 

As a Baby i did not speak... i did not look my Mother in the Eyes... I did not like sound and always feel and did not feel well in Clothes with unnessary stuff. As an Adult i mostly wear Leggings and Tops. As a kid i got coaching in writing and speaking. If i did something the first time in School i needed to watch other Children do it first and if a teacher asked me something i had issues to answer it at all. Still in 10 Grade i always needed to memoryze the sentence in my mind before spealing it out to the teacher. I stimmed all my life, but because i was a very quiet child most people did not notice or jsut did not care for me. I am now 30 and bought some earplugs and wore them several times when going for groceries. I wore them last week when playing DND and it felt so great. Why didnt i do this before? I dont know. 

Where does my doubt come from? I could also be a Borderline according to a friend who had it a long time. I have some Special Interests, but i am not an expert in them all. I just like to read about it from time to time. My biggest thing is trying to understand people and how they feel. I am not good with routines...

Currently at work everything is ok, but i have several issues in my personal life. Currently found out there are some Hospical in my Country (Germany, NRW) which would diagnose Adults with Autism. I wrote some emails to them...

So i have reached already out to professionals, but i just needed to share my feelings wirh others.

Meltdowns,"This might be a stupid question. This is all so new to me. My son is 3 and autistic. He has extreme meltdowns and whenever I talk about these to my other mom friends (kids aren‚Äôt autistic) they either can‚Äôt relate or they think talking about tantrums. I‚Äôm not, these are meltdowns triggered by things...I just wish I knew what. So I figured asking this community might be helpful for me. 

My son is verbal but scripts a lot and has echolalia. He doesn‚Äôt do a lot of conversational give and take and half the time we really don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs listening to us or not. It‚Äôs sorta hard to tell. He has awfully huge meltdowns and they‚Äôve increased in frequency lately. He just screams NO!!!! and wails. He really gets loud and intense. Many times people have asked me if he‚Äôs ok when they happen. These can last awhile and even if he quiets down and seems to be calm again, anyone talking to him or around him sometimes sets him off again. This has us wishing we (me and my husband) could help him through these better, or even to avoid them more often. (For instance, after nap he had one once and my mil was over and kept asking him what was wrong and he would just scream bloody murder yet also seem confused and desperate for help calming down). 

I have gotten advice to ‚Äújust ask him what was wrong when he‚Äôs happy again‚Äù but that doesn‚Äôt work with my kid. He lives in the moment, doesn‚Äôt answer questions well, and especially questions about the past or the future. In response to ‚Äúwhat made you so sad?‚Äù Or ‚Äúwhy did you scream?‚Äù he simply says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy!‚Äù (This is because he‚Äôs happy when I asked about it. Not happy during the meltdown). 

I‚Äôve noticed my husband is having a difficult time with this communication barrier. I just want us to be able to embrace who our child is and to learn the best ways to parent someone who is autistic. We were getting home services from an early child special educator but since schools closed we will not be doing that for now. 

Is there any books on this? In what ways (if you‚Äôre autistic) did your parents or others help you through meltdowns?

Question: Anyone else with Autism or Developmental Delays that has Incontinence?,"Hello Everyone,

I'm 27 and I'm embarrassed to bring this up, but I feel alone on days I have accidents and don't know if I'm the only one. I had a brain bleed as a preemie and development issues that affect my nerves and brain signals. My spine, brain and bladder developed different than normal. I had brain surgery to put a shunt in my head for hydrocephalus caused by the brain bleed when I was 18 months old. I am also on the autism spectrum, have learning disabilities, and I‚Äôm behind others maturity-wise.

I have to wear Northshore Supreme diapers at night, because I wet the bed and pull ups leak too much. Then, in the day I have to wear GoodNites pull ups when   I'm not at home, because my mind gets too busy and I'm not always near a bathroom. (Since I have an alarm on my phone that helps when Im at home.) I get nervous because sometimes people make comments, like they did in school growing up. (just like with my social skills and me being repetitive and not knowing when to stop talking)

Has  anyone here ever had a brain bleed or something like it? Also, does anyone else have problems with accidents like me due to their brain not always getting the signal on time? I hope I'm not repeating myself, I just feel alone some days if I have an accident.

He has credentials as long as your arm, and he seems to be a really great fellow, but he said he hasn't even gotten one interview (we were both laid off at the same time).

It matters to me that I am respectful, not condescending, and supportive in a genuine and authentic fashion. When we connected, I did all I could to point him in the right direction for helpful resources.

He's in the middle of job loss, his parents are ill, his dad especially so, and I want more than anything to make sure I'm not adding to his problems but reducing them (as much as possible long distance).  To that end, I'm reaching out here to ask for insights on how best to proceed.

Should I get evaluated?,"Hi. I'm a 23 year old female and I've lately been considering if I should get evaluated for autism. I've sort of always wanted to because I've always felt ""off"" but I always talk myself out of it because I'm afraid the doctor will think...I don't know. I guess that I'm a hypochondriac?

I'm also afraid to talk about it with family because they will definitely think I'm being dramatic. I love my family and have a generally good relationship with them but they're the type of people who believe autism is over-diagnosed and they also will probably think I'm doing it to find an excuse.

My life has come to a bit of a stand still over the past few years because I dropped out of college and have been too afraid to go back because I get so overwhelmed having to work and do school at the same time. I know there are many people who do school full-time and work full-time but I just haven't been able to master that. I can barely work part time and do school full time.

Over the years, I've learned that autism does manifest in females differently. More recently, I was looking into Asperger's and I found [this](https://taniaannmarshall.wordpress.com/2013/03/26/moving-towards-a-female-profile-the-unique-characteristics-abilities-and-talents-of-asperwomen-adult-women-with-asperger-syndrome/) website. I printed the list and went through it, seeing which ones I could relate to and I related to 86.

I'm still scared that I'm just stretching but I would really like to understand myself a little bit better if I could. One of the things I related to most on the list was not having a strong sense of self or identity. It's something I've always wanted but no identity has almost become my identity(at least in my head).

I'm not sure why else to seek a diagnosis, other than maybe I could get some help at school that would make it less awful for me. I don't have the option to not work. But I also have 5 cats and 2 dogs and myself to support. Luckily my mom has allowed me to live in her house for free, but I know that is not going to last forever, nor do I want it to. I need to do something about myself.

I'm sorry for the long post and I'm sorry if I'm being dramatic. I feel slimy trying to self-diagnose anything. This is something I've been struggling with for a long time and I only want answers. Please, any advice you have would be appreciated.",autism,1585113595,oliveball,14,1,True,2020-03-25

Surreal,"I just went to get groceries. But it is quiet in the streets and in the supermarket, everyone looked as if something was going on. Everyone seems to look autistic to me. Hard to pinpoint but definitely they didn't feel at ease. 

They seemed more aware of each other, making sure not to get close. Alert.  People looking funny at each other.

And I just realized how wonderful this is. Maybe now they understand what it feels like to be ASD. To always be aware of the other. To avoid getting close because you don't like to be touched or bumped into.

Suddenly all of society is forced to be more like us. And all it takes is less dead people than some river floods that happened at some point in China, killing 40.000 people!

I love this quiet. I wish it was always like so. Few people. This must have been a bit like what other pandemics felt like to people. Spanish flu, the plague, when half your street could end up dead and afterwards you were left standing there looking in wonder who's gonna fill those homes now.

Life in 1800 might have in some ways been like this. Cities were smaller. The world less crowded. 

And it is less noisy. And I am not even prone to that type of sensitivity. For many here it must feel just as wonderful, even more so. 

I wonder if without modern medicine and sanitation and the rest of it, this outbreak would be similar to something like the Spanish Flu. 

I always was a fan of apocalyptic books. And I am much in favor of demographic policies that reduce populations.  I live in one of the most densely populated countries in the world.

Females with autism - questions,"Hello, 

I am a 24 year old female diagnosed with anxiety and struggling with mental illness since I was 10. 

I've never asked a doctor, never even spoken to more than just 2 of my closest and only friends about it. But every now and then I see the topic brought up and I spiral into my questions again. 

I know autism can be different in females. I haven't done enormous research but I know its often over looked. 

My question is, I would like to ask about your diagnosis journey and how you decided or knew to go to the doctor? When did you find out? What are your ""symptoms"" or autism behaviours that you have? 

Let me discuss myself a bit: 

1) I am not a good vocal verbalizer. I can't properly or comfortably express emotions when I speak outloud to anyone. 

2) I hate physical contact of all kinds. It makes me cringe and fall back and my anxiety sky rockets 2hen they do. 

3) I constantly feel like I'm 6 steps behind in social situations. Like everyones in on a play with a script but I never got the script. I don't know how to fork relationships or how to approach people. I've gotten really good at watching others and copying them to the point where my friend said I seem normal. 

4) I don't do well with change, especially unplanned. I always thought it was just anxiety but when my routines have to change I start to freak out and my anxiety skyrockets. 

5) when multiple people are talking or the room gets too loud I get anxious and have to exit the room and regathee myself. I get really anxious if more than one person talks to me. If I'm in the metro or bus and I don't have my earphones with music to block people out I get jittery and anxious and restless. 

6) I've been swaying/rocking side to side and front to back as long as I can remmeebr. It's so soothing to me, especially when I'm surrounded by people in the metro or in a group setting, job I terviews, class presentations etc to the point that my firenf actually had to stop me once because I was doing it excessively. 

7) I've been painfully shy as far back as I can remmeebr. I used to always need to have someone talk for me when I needed something and sometimes still do. 

I can't think of anything immediate off my head.bmy biggest worry is that I'm self diagnosing because thats not what I want to do. I'm just so tired of feeling burned out, and not understanding how to handle situations. I feel like a fucking alien in this world and everything is hard. In a group I either overcompensate or pull back entirely. It's like I understand how to act but I don't truly under. I tried describing this to my friend but he counter acted me with this comment that's been making my mind race ever since and I know it's not how I feel but I'm not sure anyways... I'm rambling but here is the message he sent: 

""I'm just a little curious because to me, a lot of what you're saying is stuff i've always considered ''the norm''? like we all learn to interact by looking at others. We all pick up on stuff others do to try and get them to like us more? We all assess how we're doing in a social situation by how many people are laughing and smiling? Idk that's how i've interpreted it anyways.""

It made me think, but the way he's describing it isn't how it is in my head but I don't know how to put my head into words. It's beyond that. 

I'm turning to you in a desperate plea to find some form of support or story/experience to try and clarify. I can only see my PCP after the COVID-19 situation is over because of new quarantine shut downs and regulations.

Manners Courtesy and Eiiquite.Really society? But I'm autistic and can' t fake emotion.,"Society created a large database of things one must do in order to be considered civilized, so to speak. Certain things one must do at a certain time and/or place, in a certain order. 

I have a new friend who was upset when after a long conversation, I was distracted, so I didn't answer the question she had asked and didn't say goodbye. I said to her 'you got upset I didn't say goodbye? Why? you couldn't see I was gone? But I didn't bid you ""fare thee well"" so I am an asshole now who ghosted you?"" One little thing I did after a long, genuine, and truthful conversation was ruined by society's standard you should tell the person you are leaving at ending the conversation. A fake courtesy.

I have severe selective auditory attention. If I'm focused on something I go deaf.  Multiple times I've been walking somewhere thinking, thinking or looking at something when a parent or coworker called out, ""Good Morning!"" I'm so engrossed, that I can't hear them so they think I'm being rude for not answering. Taking great and take offense at my deficit. A totally made up societal standard that you are required to say the greeting back to the giver.

I've done this for years. Walk up to a coworker and ask a question. We converse, they give the answer  was looking for so I about face and I walk off, halfway in the middle of their sentences. It's like a program. I go seek the answer, get the answer, get back to what I needed the answer for.  Apparently, I'm notorious for it which obviously probably didn't make me a ton of friends!

Autistic people, in general, are extremely truthful, honest and direct. We don't fake emotions and are genuine about how we feel. This makes us brutally honest. We tell someone the truth and they get upset because it wasn't the response they are looking for. My wife asks me to tell her the truth how her hair looks.  My response is that I hate it, it's the worst haircut ever and she should shave her head! She asked me?! Why did she get so upset? I was very honest and truthful and told her truthfully how I felt about it! That's not fair, I should not be yelled at and punished because I didn't know that I was supposed to start acting and lying and pretend that I like it, to spare her feelings! She specifically asked me to be truthful too!  I have mindblindness, an inability to take someone else perspective. So I had no way of predicting her answer would cause her to attack! As you probably know this inability to read people's minds gets me in aton of trouble.  The societal courtesy is that one must take others into a consideration!  To not do this is considered extremely rude and even mean.


Autistic' who are known to be truthful, honest, genuine and open with their feeling, are asked by society to be able to remember when to pretend to act certain ways at certain circumstances. We are asked to fake certain emotions at certain times, and say certain made up greetings, at others. But when we don't do something in the exact right order and right time, we are the rude and mean ones who are uncivilized!

I think perhaps courtesy and manners were made by a bunch of controlling fake liers. 

So next time someone gets onto me for breaking one of the societal standards from hell, I might try saying  ""I'm Autistic, that is a fake and discriminatory societal standard. I am unable to conform due to my inability to fake emotions and lie about what I really think and know about things!""

We know society has trained us into thinking and behaving, certain ways at certain times. We are expected to create a ""mask"" we can wear while out in society. My mask is a perfect gentleman,(so they tell me) polite and courteous with excellent manners. Until the mask is gone and broken for some reason that day, then I'm rude for being overly truthful, overly dramatic or expressing my true feelings. Too blunt for getting straight to the point.

So the next time you get in trouble for some societal faux pas, don't be ashamed and guilty like society wants you to feel! Be proud of the fact that you are literally too genuine to be able to act and fake all of the random rules and regulations society is forcing us, against our nature to conform to.  They are going to try to convince you it was incredibly rude and impolite and hurt their feelings. You not doing a fake lie hurt their feelings!

Being conscious as a parent,"Good day, or night, everyone! 

This is more targeted towards autistic individuals, young and old, but if any parents have any input that is also welcome.

What might be something I am overlooking, from your point of view? Obviously, you are not the parent, but I wonder what perspective you all might have when it comes to moments of uncertainty like right now where so much is open-ended. Any memories you might have when you were young where there might have been instances of tragedy or emergency.

My son is still so young, only 4 and a half, and as far as I can tell he's pretty oblivious to what is happening ( I could be wrong, he's not much of a talker, but I do notice he has been stimming a whole lot more since we have had a change in routine). I am not someone that goes into panic mode and I haven't  struggled with ""keeping myself together"" these past few weeks.

What \*does\* bother me right now is all the input I am receiving from the school, dreaded mommy groups, and his OT and ST therapists about what I ""should"" be doing.

My thought is this: I shouldn't have to worry too much about this. This is partly due to me feeling that at his age he should just be playing anyway. Academics and ""life skills"" can wait. My son appears to be enjoying the break from school and his therapy sessions...and I'm not so caught up in my worries about ""regressions"". I am anti-ABA so I don't have a BCBA hovering over my head, either.

There is a part of me that wonders if I am being too nonchalant over this and I should be doing more at this time, though. Then again I am not neglecting his sensory needs---which is a big one.

Greetings and some questions,"TLDR: Are my descriptions of my experiences concurrent with yours? I have multiple diagnosis and I‚Äôm trying to tell one problem apart from the other. 

Hi guys. After being investigated and suspected of various learning disabilities since childhood, huge social problems all my younger life, trauma and eventual mental health spiral, I think my quest for self discovery has ended at 29 years of age, and I can focus on recovery. I have 2 really good therapists, and really good doctors. 

I am, and always have had trouble identifying my experiences of self like emotion and pain. So I try to use examples from my own memory to sort of bounce what I think is happening with me, off others of similar experience because I‚Äôm told severe (like fucked up) trauma over a long time can really distort what is real, what is felt, what is thought of, and it‚Äôs intent. My current diagnosis is: CTrauma, DID/OSDD, ASD, whole bunch of personality psychopathology. Also have a seizure disorder, sleep disorder, stomach warfare, etc. Please help me sorta compartmentalize my experiences into the appropriate box of pathology by letting me know if any of these experiences sound similar to yours.  

1) Eye contact. I don‚Äôt like confrontation any more than any one else, but everyone has to take a stand at some point for something. I hate that I can‚Äôt do a stare down. I can neither give nor take a compliment from any one ever and look at their face even. There are 0 times in my life I have shook hands with some one and looked any where but at their hands. Some times I‚Äôll have spent hours with a person and not even remember their face because I never looked. So why ask? Because it‚Äôs not that I am discomforted from looking. It‚Äôs that I don‚Äôt know how much to. Because seemingly random people have gotten into fights with me for ‚Äúwhat are you looking at?‚Äù  And female friends have gotten creeped out because when I‚Äôm interested or excited in a subject I forget to look away. Or I accidentally give people the wrong ideas. Sadly, there was even a time when a girl in school told on me for staring at her when I was just zoned out staring at a doorknob and then she decided to stand there and have a conversation with some one. Thankfully I already had a reputation for staring at doorknobs for hours in class at that point so people just corrected her. But like is this an accurate elaboration of the issue? I‚Äôm definitely an introvert (not socially, but I love being in my own head vs in the world). But I‚Äôm not shy or anxious at default settings. The repercussions of too much or too little are making me not. Does that make sense? So I got super good at ‚Äúblink shifting‚Äù my eyes to take breaks, appearing to be in thought or turning my head to make it seem like I can‚Äôt hear right (2 birds and no stones!). 

2) speech: I don‚Äôt like being made to talk for no reason. I can‚Äôt stand it if my thoughts are interrupted to engage in meaningless conversation. This has a lot to do with seizures, memory problems, and lost my train of thought type of problems. But if I‚Äôm quiet and still it means I‚Äôm doing something in my head. Not idle or on standby. I‚Äôm probably creating a poem, rehearsing a presentation or the start of a new relationship, or the next craziest team combo in a game. If your problem is of greater value than these things I shall speak to you. If it‚Äôs not but I care about you you may insist. And depending on how much I care about you I may insist on declining. That said, looking at this post, and imagining a person just speaking this at you, that is also how I talk. If some one asks me ‚Äúwhat do you think about the weather?‚Äù I‚Äôd like a couple of days heads up to prepare please. Unless you meant ‚Äúenjoying the weather?‚Äù In which case I‚Äôll say ‚Äúno‚Äù then wait an excruciatingly long time for you to ask ‚Äúoh... why?‚Äù which I would like a heads up to prepare also. 

There are things I hate about speaking that I don‚Äôt see talked about as much or in the detail I‚Äôm looking for I guess (or I looked wrong). I feel like the air flowing out of me when I speak is restricted. Like I really have to physically squeeze it out like when you have a blocked nose or something. I get the kind of head ache from talking that I also get from straining... for whatever reason. And after I speak for a bit I actually feel tired in the trunk. I am also extremely discomforted by the sound of my own voice. I can feel it vibrating in the airspace‚Äôs inside my skull. 

Volume control and formality. There is a line. And I think it‚Äôs super fine. I get why it‚Äôs important in general because I know I have a hard time hearing soft voices at all, and loud speech feels painful to me. I‚Äôm not yelling all the time. But I feel like I‚Äôm the only person I know who people have to remind ‚Äúlow low! Keep it low!‚Äù Not because there is a baby sleeping in the next room, but because I‚Äôm embarrassingly loud at a bar with live music. I can‚Äôt hear myself well over a sound, so I assume no one can. Same with ambient noise. AC is on, dude is yelling. Politely. Politely tone dead yelling. Which brings me to formality. Can‚Äôt talk to your boss like that. Or your old school grandma. She only believes in the Quran, not the Bible, not the DSM. 

3) Hearing: example, I play games online with my friends often, and we party chat. If I‚Äôm playing with one person, flawless team play because I can hear him, I‚Äôm anticipating one team mate, and I can communicate with him. Add player 3. Now we have chatter. Some one cracking jokes. Suddenly sounds like I‚Äôm hearing things from under water. The number of ‚Äúwait can you repeat that, and wait I can‚Äôt hear you‚Äù increases 10 fold. But I can still respond to the implications and I pick the important words and most context. With the next guy there is too much small talk to follow. I can‚Äôt play if I listen and I can‚Äôt play well if I don‚Äôt listen. I make mistakes, apologize way too much even when I don‚Äôt have to. Player 5 will often find me mistaking jokes for insults or vice versa, everyone will be laughing and I‚Äôll be all ‚Äúha... haha... yeah... good one... I totally heard everything‚Äù but in my head. People will be trying to speak to me by name and I‚Äôll be unable to emit enough air to make sounds. And they will often misinterpret my frustration with my own paralysis as anger at them for raging at me because I didn‚Äôt do XYZ in the game. I can assure you, 11 a side team sports were not something I was good at. I can‚Äôt even play FIFA video games because I don‚Äôt know where to send the ball because the AIs are too unpredictable, despite having some skill with a football and my feet in general. 

4) Seizures: do those of you who have this struggle notice it happen sort of in conjunction with a panic attack or a ‚Äúshut down‚Äù? Quotes because I have serious issues with dp/dr, what the docs call seizures, and existential crises aka panic attacks. I guess the question is, do you feel like a panic attack or sensory overload often precede a seizure for you? Do you ever get the all in one combo? I feel like people should come with replaceable fuses. 

5) Food is a matter of taste. If it tastes good I‚Äôll eat what I‚Äôm told is about half of the full appetite of another person of my body weight. I don‚Äôt care that it‚Äôs free. Yes I willingly came to eat all I can eat. And I have done exactly that. Also I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôd eat something I don‚Äôt like for a million dollars but I‚Äôm also sure the threshold is way higher for me than anyone else I know. I‚Äôll go hungry if I don‚Äôt like it and it‚Äôs all I have for another 2 days. I also hate sleeping. I suck at it. I wish I didn‚Äôt have to keep doing something I fail at every other night.

Wondering whether I might have ASD in combination or instead of my ADHD?,[removed],autism,1585191559,T1nyJazzHands,0,1,True,2020-03-25
Diagnosis,"I am not officially diagnosed with autism yet and I am still doing research but I wanted help with confirming if I have traits of ASD before and try to ask for a diagnosis so I don‚Äôt embarrass myself to much. Here are some things about me.


1. Communication is a big problem with me, when me and my parents or friends go out to eat at a restaurant I always have to tell my family/friends what I want so they can tell them, and sometimes when they force me to order by myself I am to quiet and stutter and trip over my words so much that my peers just end up ordering for me. It‚Äôs the same with school when I‚Äôm trying to talk in a group I don‚Äôt know when to talk so I usually get talked over or they get annoyed and tell me to be quiet.

2.Stims, I know everyone stims but when I do it it is usually very violent like swinging my head back and forth or side to side (of course I do have less violent ones like chewing on stuff or fidgeting with what I‚Äôm holding). When I start stimming I have to literally force my self to put something down even if it makes me extremely uncomfortable.

3.Textures and clothing are a big inconvenience in my life too. I can‚Äôt wear anything scratchy or bumpy, anything constricting like tight belts and elastics are a big no no. My school has a uniform that includes belts if you wear pants, so I had to ditch wearing pants to school. My school also provides and requires that we wear their gym uniform that has an elastic waist band,  that band has made by cry multiple times. I can‚Äôt wear low rise shoes like vans, only high tops or higher. Also no clumpy fabrics. I have favorite textures too though, like soft brushes and silk.

4.Noises, if their loud that‚Äôs a big no no. People yelling at me or someone yelling at someone near me causes me to cringe and in some cases cry. It doesn‚Äôt even have to be directed toward me, just loud upsets me all together.This has gotten even in trouble with my mom when she is scolding  me.

5.Sensory Overload is a problem too, someone sniffling in the back of class while the teacher yells at a kid with a video playing in the background and other classes walking down the hallway and a kid rummaging in their backpack next to me will cause me to curl up and cry as I cover my ears to tut and block out the sound and close my eyes tight to stop everything from being so much. 

6. My obsession over everything cute and anime, oh your talking about how hard gym was how about an Animal Crossing fact, oh you didn‚Äôt start your science project yet what about an anime that I‚Äôm watching. It often causes me to get kicked out of conversations.

7. Let‚Äôs not forget to mention how I can‚Äôt read peoples emotions or the atmosphere of a room so I often make people awkward. My friend was once upset about her friend being rude to her and I couldn‚Äôt read that and I made a joke and she got upset with me. I also sometimes misunderstand simple jokes or metaphors(are they called metaphors?), like when someone told me about someone had a devil on their shoulder I was trying to look for a plush devil on their shoulder.

I know this was a lot to read and I‚Äôm sorry about that I just want to know if I should try to get diagnosed or not, I don‚Äôt really want to embarrass myself (as I said before social confrontations are upsetting)

Autism and ADHD,"I will try to make this short with a bit of context:

I went to my psychiatrist appointment today and we talked about ADHD. He asked me a bunch of questions about how I was in school when I was a kid, and how I am today in classes. He told me I had mild ADHD, which is common for people who are on the spectrum and it didn't surprise me at all.

I've always been very quiet in class, not drawing any attention to me (still the same) but when I was a kid a remember day-dreaming a lot, and wouldn't be able to retain any information from class. I would try to focus on what was being said by the teacher, but my mind would wander off every single time. 

I didn't fail any of my school years, failed 2 subjects in my course in high school (I was taking Science and Technology - failed maths and physics), ended up taking a different course just so I could get into Uni and graduated in Sports Science even if I wasn't interested in this career (never worked in the field).

Now, last year I took interested in digital design and development and enrolled in a course (it's very basic) and so far I'm doing very well. 

I've always had trouble sleeping and apparently it's also related to ADHD my psychiatrist talked to me about some medications for it. I feel like I'm doing okay at managing everything (both autism and adhd) BUT I've always felt like I'm there is something holding me back from giving my full potential.

He asked me to look at these particular medications:

for sleep: Trazodone

for ADHD: Methylphenidate (ritalin) and Dexanfetamine - both stimulant

and another one: Atomoxetine

&amp;#x200B;

Does any one have any advice/recommendation? Is it worth it? Can I try a medication for a week or 2 and see the effects and stop if I want to? What if it actually helps a lot and will be able to see things clearly for once, would it lead me to having to take everyday and being dependant? Could I stop after?

I spoke to my mom and she is very apprehensive...And I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed nd don't really know what I should do.

My father calls me a liar,"(Content Warning: Drugs, medication, mental illness, family issues)
This is a very lengthy read, the important bit is the last paragraph, the rest is background information.

I'm a 28-year old autist who's found out about a year ago. My mother (whose father is autistic as well) instantly understood and is crazy helpful, while my father didn't really react at all but would still support me.

Two years ago.
I'm on financial support (initially because of a diagnosed burnout and depression by my former child physician and psychotherapist), having recently had to quit university in my last year because there is no way you can afford student insurance if you're working minimum wage in Germany.

I have a roommate that I went through thick and thin with. He's been my best friend for almost 20 years and my roommate for five years now. At some point he started smoking weed, which I never had bad experiences with, so I joined him every once in a while and found that it gave me a similar sort of respite that I'd find in antidepressants during darker times, but without feeling like shit the next day. My roommate might be autistic as well, he's definitely neurodivergent, so he always came off as weird, too, but he's far more social than I could ever be.

This is important because my father always suspected him to be all kinds of things, a thief, a no-good and most recently a pothead. So obviously, one day he tells me very clearly, that if he ever finds out I'm taking drugs... He never finished that sentence. I don't know. The fact that he used the words ""if I ever find out"" made my skin crawl. It sounded like my father was constantly investigating me.

I called him that day, even though I hate being on the phone, and I told him I don't like having things assumed about me, that it's my life and that he can come out and accuse me of something directly if he needs to. He apologised and seemed kinder from there on out.

So after him pressing me for two years to get a therapist (I went to one childhood therapist who merely told me that I'd obviously hate my parents, which to this day isn't true), it took me about seven months until I had someone who was open for a new patient.

About one year ago.
I found out about my autism during the first therapy session. I immediately enjoyed therapy as an experience, but over the next three sessions I'd realise how the therapist would just go on about how my childhood tastes are perfectly in line (The Hobbit, Gulliver's Travels, Neverending Story, etc.), or he'd talk about politics and himself, which I find interesting, but irrelevant in my seeking a better life. He had me write up a full biography and never spoke to me about it. One morning I was incredibly anxious so I wrote him an email to reschedule. His email address was in the biggest damn font, but he never answered, I reckon it's because he's somewhat of a fossil and didn't check his mail that day.

So I stopped going. I didn't know what to do, I can't stand being on the telephone, which he could have known had he checked his notes.

So between me telling my father that I'm not sick but overwhelmed and my mother supporting the hell out of me and being a complete angel, turns out that my father didn't believe me the first time and doesn't believe me now. We've had Christmas together, which takes a huge toll on my energy reserves every year, I've celebrated his birthday with him, I go to a lot of trouble making time for him because he's my father and I want to be in his life, but he's pulled stunts like this two or three times every year and they always completely shoot me down.

The last one was us visiting my brother about a year ago, before I found out about being ND (my brother suffers from schizophrenic paranoia and psychosis). My father had me get something from the car and when I came back I had to cross a street to get to them, after which he said ""why don't you go back and get run over"" with the biggest smile, where even my dear brother said ""that's not funny"".

I've struggled with suicidal tendencies all my life. Even without knowing that I'm autistic, he could have just maybe seen how fucking inappropriate that joke is to someone who supposedly has mental problems. He has spent years in therapy himself. I still can not figure that one out. He just asked us ""was that too much?""

I was there to visit my brother. Instead I had to hold myself together through the entire day, be a good son and manage to eat food while under pressure. Before that day, my father and I would go on regular road trips and they'd always be enjoyable. I couldn't even stand seeing him now.

Last week. (TL;DR)
He told me of his suspicion about my autism during Sunday dinner at a restaurant. We used to meet at this place for five years every Sunday. When I started taking antidepressants two years ago, my sleeping routine became so out of whack that I'd wake up at 5pm sometimes, regardless of when I actually went to sleep, so I regretfully had to cut the Sunday lunches in favour of my personal health. He was very kind about it and still is today, but now I know it's not because of his great appreciation for his special son, it's not because he's an Autism Dad, it's because he thinks I'm hypersensitive and a pothead.

I on the other hand have difficulties eating breakfast since then, am constantly overly aware of my surroundings and I have a knot in my stomach that even Alexander the Great couldn't cleave asunder.

Would it be insensitive to call myself autistic?,"Last year my mom took me to see a therapist after showing signs of anxiety (which runs in my family), when my mom talked about my behaviors and other things, the therapist said that I likely have autism.

I went to a psychiatrist for anxiety shortly after and she said that she would diagnose me with autism if she felt like it would help at school, and she didn‚Äôt. I went to a doctor who is an autism specialist and she said that I probably have autism but she would have to do more tests to be sure. The struggle of telling myself ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt say you‚Äôre autistic, you‚Äôre not. You just think you have it to seem cool,‚Äù makes me very anxious and I wanted to know if you guys would support me until I get tested again (which will be in March).

I hate it when people interrupt conversations!,"is it just an autism thing? or did people teach me the wrong things about conversation etiquette that resulted in me seeing it as a bad thing?

Unless it's just a one-on-one, I am not confident in conversations if I'm a third person involved at the table when two other people are continuously talking back and forth.  I feel like they don't sense a need for even timing for everybody involved.  It's like they don't represent the commas or periods in the sentence they have speech for.

The teacher at school programmed me to raise me hand to avoid verbal interruption, and ever since then, I started to seek out alternatives to avoid anything that constitutes ""interruption"" in conversations.

Any time there's a PERIOD in the sentences I finish, I usually pause my talking to see if others want to talk before I just go off continuing to talk, but sometimes somebody will start saying something a couple seconds after I initiate saying something.

I go off talking about TIMING and suggesting management of the SECONDS of timing of it.

Intro and question about possible nonverbal stuff? I don‚Äôt know.,"Hi, first time poster here.
To start off, I was diagnosed with PDD-NOS at a young age. In middle school I was taken back and retested for autism which, thanks to a parent who was scary and caused me to behave differently than when I was in a more relaxed environment, the doctors said I no longer have autism. Over the following years multiple mental health staff, nurses, SP-ED teachers, etc. commented that they believe I still have autism because of my behaviours. (I‚Äôm planning on getting retested in the next year) 
But anyways, I‚Äôve noticed in situations where I‚Äôm really stressed or excited I either stutter really badly to the point that I can hardly talk whatsoever and can spend upwards to five minutes trying to spit out words, or I end up getting ‚Äústuck‚Äù on words. (I end up repeating the first part of a word or an entire word over and over again). Otherwise I notice in some situations where I‚Äôm in an unfamiliar place or with unfamiliar people I can‚Äôt speak. When I do it‚Äôs very limited. I‚Äôd want to say something but can‚Äôt bring myself to do so. Almost like someone cheering you on saying yeah say hi say hi but I open my mouth say the first syllable and can‚Äôt force the rest of the word out. And with the upbringing of Tik-Tok, I follow a lot of autistic people who share their stories of being nonverbal/semi nonverbal/selectively mute. So I was wondering could this be like one of those? Am I just being a hypochondriac? Or am I just imagining it to be bigger than it is or just being a drama queen?

Terminator 1 vs Terminator 2,"I watch both films last night, and I was hit with a sudden realisation that I‚Äôve never really paid attention to the connection between these 2 films.

Every since a kid I‚Äôve always loved T2, but it dawned on me last night (once the connections clicked) that I actually prefer T1 now.

It was really weird, I was watching T1, which I haven‚Äôt seen for some years, and all the references started linking to T2, which I‚Äôve watched more frequently.

It kind of upset me to a certain degree that the pedestal I‚Äôd put T2 on for 25 years was solely based on the visual impact. Also, now I feel the second movie was basically a remake of number one with a bigger budget.

I don‚Äôt know why, but growing up T1 just didn‚Äôt do it for me. Not sure if it‚Äôs the lack of quality of the visuals, or the element of a new concept I couldn‚Äôt digest at that age.

I‚Äôm really intrigued to understand if anyone else has experienced this. Also, does anyone feel that things start clicking more when exposed to others POV i.e. watching YouTube reaction videos? Not in the sense that you understand what they‚Äôre reacting to more, but as though by watching them, you acquire that skill somehow, which can be used in different areas.

A question about personal meltdown experiences,"My daughter has autism, and her meltdowns have become much more frequent and intense on a daily basis, so I am really hoping to get some feedback so I can help her in the most positive way possible.

Sometimes when she melts down, she sort of snaps and becomes really aggressive and violent. But what concerns me the most is that she has expressed there is ""a bad side of her brain that takes over"" and tells her to kill or to hurt others. She's never hurt her baby brother, thankfully, and she has told me it has never even entered her mind.

Once I am able to help her through the meltdown, it's like she snaps back into her sweet and normal personality - but usually, she will be stimming a lot after or sometimes shut down. I help her through her meltdowns by cradling her, singing, letting her feel and smell me holding her, etc. Sometimes it's just a matter of getting close enough (she knocked one of my teeth out once).

Has anyone else experienced these feelings firsthand? It is so important to me that I treat her as a worthy, lovable autonomous human being.

So, my brother has autism. He's 18 but still unable to pass his GCSE's (high school grade) and he can't really look after himself, we keep pushing him the best we can, but he cannot grasp the meaning of money and he will panic if he's ever in a situation where he doesn't know what to do. 

He's in college at the moment, studying drama but he's off because he was sick on the bus once and now travelling scares him. So he just refuses to go. So we're trying to deal with that at the moment.

So my mums biggest worry is what will happen when she dies. Which is morbid I know, but we have to discuss it for my brother's sake. But I'm not sure what I can do. We live in the UK. I'm 25, single, still living at home because getting my own place for myself is too expensive. So I'll probably have to move out when she passes. But my brother wouldn't be able to do that. I've explained that I would ""Take him under my wing"" and have him live with me, but I doubt I'll want to do that for the rest of my life &amp; What would happen if I die?

Is there any support people that we can go see about this? We don't want him living in assisted living as it's bad enough for his own mental health. (He went to a specialist school and it just made him depressed because he knew it was for people with disabilities and he didn't feel ""right"" there.) So assisted living or supported living isn't the best way to go for his situation. He wants to be ""part of normal life"" to use his own words.

Any info / help would be appreciated.",autism,1582039113,Nevarc_Xela,17,1,True,2020-02-18

I have started research and hope you could spare about 7 minutes (if you are over 18) to complete a short questionnaire.

How can I make sure doctor diagnosis me with Asperger?,"TLDR: I'm going to the doctor tomorrow and need to make sure both him and the psychologist sign I have asperger because this would make me getting a job easier due to quotas. I believe I do have asperger but due to several reasons I'm afraid I won't get the certificate

How can I make sure doctor gives me asperger diagnosis when you really are aspie? I really am asperger and have known about it for years, but never cared since it has no cure and I am already used to it. But aspergers are considered full autists legally in my country, which has some privileges. I only want some quota in a public job contest so I can have slightly better chance at getting it.

The problem is: 1) I have serious trouble explaining things to people due to aspie. This is a catch-22 because I need to explain everything to the doctor, but since I'm failure at socializing this is hard for me 2) I unconsciously and stupidly ""try to force being more autist"" to make sure doctor believes I'm asperger, but in the end it looks more like I'm very anxious/have something else/am normal and lying or am just crazy 3) I get very anxious because this would help me so much and I'm afraid the doctor will think I'm just someone trying to have advantages falsely, that I end up looking like someone who's lying! It's catch-22's all over it. 4) My country is packed with liars who try to take advantage off everything and everyone. So since I'm bad at explaining things, doctor might think I'm one of them. Also, unprofessional doctors who might undiagnose me with anxiety disorder or something else that won't really help me

Anyways how can I make sure doctor signs I have asperger? I had a visit to him and he signed it but he didn't put the date on it, which makes it invalid lol. I think he did it on purpose because he's old and experiencd and wouldn't do it normally.

I'm going to his clinic again tomorrow and will see the psychologist before I see him. He told me to do so. I have reasons to believe they will use WAIS-III for testing. It's early tomorrow and I'll sleep soon. All help is much appreciated!",autism,1582068108,enceladu,11,1,True,2020-02-18
How can I prepare to see the Psychiatrist?,"Hi everyone, I'm a lurker here. I (21F) am seeing a psychiatrist for the first time ever in 6 days, and I am hoping to get a diagnosis for Autism Spectrum Disorder. 
I have a history with anxiety and depression and have been taking Prozac for 6 years. Not sure if that matters for anything ^^;;
I was wondering, as a female, what is the best plan to have the doctor take me seriously? I don't think the psychiatrist specializes in Autism. I live in the USA and it's impossible to find hardly anyone decent that takes my insurance in my area.
I was thinking of printing out a list of symptoms from a reputable source and highlighting them and writing notes next to them. I also took some online tests and screenshotted the results (high on ASD and low on empathy).
I know girls have it different, so I was looking for some advice.

How to help an adult having a violent meltdown?,"Content warning: descriptions of self harm, mentions of suicide

My sibiling got diagnosed with Autism as a adult a couple of years ago. We realise now that they have always had meltdowns. However, their meltdowns have gotten more and more violent towards themselves. They will scratch at their arms until they bleed, hit their head with hands or waterbottle and throw themself into the wall. They also scream things like ""you're hurting me"" and ""stop hitting me"" when no has hurt them and no one is even close to them. They will immediatley start talking about killing themelf and how they ""just need to die"". They are covered in scars from this and the neighbours have called the police thinking it was domestic abuse. When the meltdown starts to happen, we quickly try to offer ways out (""we don't have to go out"", ""we can leave later"", ""if you want to take some time in your room you can"") but it often doesn't help. Trying to talk them through it doesn't help either. Trying to leave the room to give them space also makes it worse (they think we are angry even when we tell them we are just giving them space). Anything we say seems to make it worse but it escalates badly if we don't step in at all.

All the advice I can find on this is clearly about children, not adults and won't help. It breaks my heart to see them hurt themself and I want to know if there is anything that we can do to help with this. I know that bringing this up with them will just cause a meltdown, so I am trying to find info in other places.

In the search of art for my book cover,"Fellow Redditors,

&amp;#x200B;

In the following months I am going to publish my first book on the subject of autism. This book progresses the notion that autism is not a mental or physical disorder but a mode of being that colors every aspect of one's existence. Therefore, in this book I progress the notion that autistic individuals should not be ""cured"" of the autism they *have* but should be helped to find a useful and satisfying way to *be* autistic in this world of ""neurotypicals.""

At this point I am looking for an interesting image to be presented on the cover of the book. This is why I address you today: I was wondering if you might have access to visual art *done by autistic individuals* that might be a good choice for the cover of the book. I would appreciate art done by members of r/autism or links to other databases or websites with beautiful autistic art.

To finish I'll present a quote that I identify with deeply by Jim Sinclair:

""Autism isn‚Äôt something a person has, or a 'shell' that a person is trapped inside. There‚Äôs no normal child hidden behind the autism. Autism is a way of being. It is pervasive; it colors every experience, every sensation, perception, thought, emotion, and encounter‚Äîevery aspect of existence. It is not possible to separate the autism from the person‚Äîand if it were possible, the person you‚Äôd have left would not be the same person you started with.""

Rant- I'm So Tired of Masking,"I haven't been officially diagnosed with autism, but I show all of the signs. I'm sick of constantly having to monitor every single aspect of my behavior 24/7/365. It's very frustrating. Anytime I'm around people I'm always thinking, "" don't fidget"", "" don't do anything weird with your hands"", "" don't speak too loudly"", ""don't speak too softly"", ""make eye contact"", "" don't overdo it and make too much eye contact"". 

I'm super lonely because I can't really interact with anyone on a meaningful level since I'm focused on trying to be normal the whole time. I feel like can't really listen to anyone and be a good friend and I also feel like all of my relationships are fake because no one ever gets to see the real me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have to rehearse all of my conversations, so that I can seem normal and avoid taking too long to answer questions. Even just having a normal day feels like putting on some kind of Hollywood production. It's so stressful.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm very sensitive to light and I have a very low pain tolerance, but in order to keep up the illusion of normalcy, I have to keep a poker face whenever something is physically bothering me. 

And as if all of that wasn't bad enough, my parents don't believe that there's anything wrong with me and they call me lazy, selfish, and insensitive if I don't meet their expectations of what a person should act like.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like my entire life revolves around forcing myself to act in a way that makes other people feel comfortable at all costs and sometimes I wish I could drop dead so that I wouldn't have to deal with this anymore.

We do flash cards, phonics, tracing letters and numbers.

He can count verbally and can sing his abc's, but the only letter he truly recognizes is the letter A and the letter G (first letter of his name). He calls the number 6 letter G probably because it has a similar shape.

What is your opinion about ABA?,"I recently got into the field out of pure desperation as I couldn‚Äôt find something else to do with my psychology degree and I always wanted to be in a field that ‚Äúhelps‚Äù people. However, the longer I am in this field, the less I am even sure if I am actually helping anyone. 

I‚Äôm seriously considering completely  changing my career path. Does this field do more harm than good? I know that in the past there were a lot of problems with ABA. But is this still the case? Sometimes it feels like I am watching every move the child makes and the poor child has no chance to mess up at all (while the  neurotypical kids around him get plenty of chances for the same behaviors). I also feel cruel when I watch a child cry and am forced to ignore them or force them to continue to do something they don‚Äôt want to do. Is there any way to be ethical in this field? Or is this straight up psychological abuse? 

I feel like it‚Äôs stupid to put so much effort into making these children learn a bunch of stuff that they are awful at, instead of focusing on what they are already great at and helping grow their natural talents. I understand that some behaviors are unacceptable and potentially dangerous and in those cases aba could work, but in many cases, it just doesn‚Äôt make sense why I am forcing this child to learn a skill he doesn‚Äôt know just to please the parents.

"ABA? adult (36) diagnosed last year, 2 year old son just diagnosed today","Greetings reddit!  I was diagnosed with high functioning autism in August of 2019.  My neuropsychologist used the word Aspergers a lot... he seems to agree with it being part of the autism spectrum, but disagrees with the word no longer being used.

My wife and I have suspected that our son is on the spectrum, as there are a lot of things I see him do that reminds me of myself, and there are similarities from my childhood.

Today, the neurologist officially diagnosed him with ASD.  The neurologist, the pediatrician, and several of my wife's friends have all praised ABA.  I have heard nothing but negative things about it... I have a whole list of articles.  Since I wasn't diagnosed a child, but did go to a disability preschool, speech therapy and occupational therapy as a kid, I don't really feel qualified to make a strong case.  And, I turned out fine!  I have a stable job, I have a (mostly) stable marriage, I have a very good routine so that I don't miss important things.  My wife was told that ""ABA isn't like it used to be.  They are a lot more understanding of people on the spectrum, and don't try to force people to hide their autistic traits"".

So I'm just curious what everyone here thinks of them, or even just the game as a whole! Personally I feel the game leans a little too much on the side of portraying it as something that quite heavily negatively impacts a person's life as opposed to just being different, but on the whole I found it to be quite sensitive and good overall - certainly much better than most games or even movies I've seen.

Confused,"I honestly don't know how to begin and I'm afraid this post will be too long, so I'll apologize in advance. I'll try to leave out as much as possible. I'm 33 years old and I've been battling with anxiety and panic attacks my whole adult life and I had six therapists during the whole process.

When I was 25 I was at a huge loss and my best friend got me a therapist saying she believed I was autistic. This was the firs time someone close to me had said it right in my face. Not the first time though as growing up I frequently had strangers asking my parents when we were out if I was autistic or had any ""mental"" problems. I hated and always dismissed it. I thought, as everyone in my family said, I was just too shy it was awkward. So when my best friend said it my first reaction was to laugh really loud because ""hey, autistics have problem communicating, I'm a writer, I can express well. How could I be?"" (Shame on me, that was my limited view on autism back then) So I dismissed it and the therapist did as well. Life moved on.

Meanwhile I had gone through a huge traumatic event in 2009 so anxiety and panic attacks became a huge problem and I went to a 4th, 5th, 6th therapist... There was something really wrong with me and I wanted a diagnosis. The sixth therapist finally diagnosed me (finally) me with anxiety disorder and agoraphobia last year. I was relieved, but thoughtful. These things could explain me after the trauma, not before. I didn't really bother because finally I had a diagnosis we could begin working on.

Recently my best friend told me she still thought I had autism. It got me thinking again. The first time it was brought up was in a psychiatrist room. She called my aunt into the room (my only living relative who lives with me) and made questions, but when my aunt began talking about me how I was a child she was interrupted by the psychiatrist, saying ""I don't want to hear about the past, I want to know what are her problems now so we can fix them."" We were taken aback, my aunt did as told and we didn't come back. When my best friend said she still thought I could be autistic I brought the issue to my therapist who laughed (!) and said there was NO possibility I could be autistic.

Well... My aunt said when I was a child, another aunt tried to convince my mom to take me to therapy because she thought there was ""something"" with me. My mom refused. I read about autism and I take this online quizzes (unreliable, I know) that always say ""unlikely to highly unlikely"" and I'm convinced ""this is not me"". Until yesterday I found a video on ""autism and how it manifests on girls"" because coincidentally I'm writing a novel with autistic girl characters and I want to make it right, and for the first time all that was said WAS me. I don't know what to think anymore, I'm worried, I don't like self diagnosis, I still think I'm not but when people close to you believe you are, what does that mean? If even my therapist discarded it with laughing... Should I even still consider trying to find out if I am or not? Or just trust my therapist? I'm lost.

So I'm not looking for a diagnosis from you as I completely understand why you can't and shouldn't. I'm ok with that. Just would like some feedback on this. =/",autism,1582211418,NicoleA5,5,1,True,2020-02-20

Had my first autistic shutdown in front of my new partner...,"So the title kind of says it.

He knows I‚Äôm autistic and has been very supportive, but I still worry about making him uncomfortable. I think I‚Äôm finally getting comfortable enough with him not to mask as much, so when I went into my shutdown I just let go and let it happen. I went nonverbal and was doing a lot of body-stimming (nothing harmful!)

"Question for autistic adults: How early in life do you remember ""masking"" in public?","I ask this because I've noticed that my 4-yr-old son (asd-2) rarely ever stims in public, but when we're at home he's stimming all the time.

His stimming is basically hand flapping, jumping, and making noises, and we have NO problem with it.

Why do girls always go for 'cool' guys?,"Hi, I am a 16-year old with autism.

Currently, my social life is not going well, and it really upsets me. In fact, it upsets me so much that I need to write/type it down somewhere. I thought maybe this was a place where I could do that...

I'm in 5th grade, in a class with more girls than boys. The boys do not really interest me that much, because they have childish and not funny behavior. It also may have to do with that my general view on girls is more positive than on boys (now I don't mean to hurt anyone with this statement, but in my life the kind people I met were almost always female)

However, I somehow can't find the courage to walk up to a girl, even if I only wanna be friends with her, and nothing more. 

Meanwhile, the majority of the girls give attention to the other boys, the boys who act childish and unfunny, and that saddens me to no end.

And here is where I see a pattern. Girls always seem to go with the bad, the so called 'cool' boys who can't behave themselves. Just so you know, this was also already the case in 4th grade.

But is there any reason for this? Surely there must be something why girls always go for the 'cool' boys, right? Wouldn't it be more advantageous for both me and the girls if they just hung up with me? Then I could possibly become more social, and have a more fun time at school, and they won't end up getting hurt by these 'cool' boys and actually have a good friendship with a guy.",autism,1582230809,Axtasma,3,2,True,2020-02-20

And then when they say I can‚Äôt make fun of this person because he has autism, like where was this idea 5 minutes ago when you decided to joke about it.",autism,1582231402,oceangirlojme20,28,1,True,2020-02-20
I (f21) think I have autism. Has anyone been diagnosed as an adult and is there even a benefit to it?,"Hi y‚Äôall. I think I have autism and I‚Äôm 21. I thought one could only get diagnosed as a kid or any doctor would have noticed by now. My partner actually brought up a few things he‚Äôs noticed about me and thinks I should go see a professional.

I didn‚Äôt start talking until I was 4 and had multiple hearing tests done because I wasn‚Äôt responding to my name. Doctors thought I was deaf, but I just figured I was a late bloomer. As a child my parents would play pretend with me where they would pretend to be someone my age and I would practice interactions with them. This went on until I went to university because I have always struggled to read a room. I usually don‚Äôt react unless other people do so I can just copy their behavior. I am also obsessed with water. I started swimming at 3 and my mom said my doctor suggested it because it helps. I swam until I was 18 because I just loved being in the water. The best way to describe being in the water is that it just makes sense to me in ways very few things do. I remember I used to stay at practice for hours because I just didn‚Äôt want to get out. I also get like overwhelmed in version environments. Recent meltdown was when my sister and I went to a small dinner. It was so small and babies were crying, people shouting orders, people being too close to me, and I just started crying because it was too much. My sister was really embarassed, but told me, ‚ÄúI should have known better, let‚Äôs go home‚Äù. 

The main thing my partner noticed is I can‚Äôt really tell humor apart and certain patterns of speech. Sometimes my parents would say something, ‚Äúyesterday you said this‚Äù and I would get upset because I said that weeks ago. It‚Äôs not nice to lie and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs nice to say that. That doesn‚Äôt make sense. I don‚Äôt get it. Then my parents would get upset at me for overreacting and say they didn‚Äôt mean it literally. This situation has happened multiple times. For humor I‚Äôll sometimes say something that I think is hilarious but no one gets it, or when someone says something ‚Äúfunny‚Äù I won‚Äôt laugh. 

When I told my mom my suspicions she got really defensive. She said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always prepared you. Remember that one time you struggled with reading and speaking and I hired that tutor to teach you. You made A‚Äôs in class‚Äù. A teacher pointed out to my parents I couldn‚Äôt read because she made the class read outloud for some reason, but I could read just fine, it was the speaking part I struggled with. When I told my mom about how I didn‚Äôt start speaking until 4 she said, ‚Äúyou did not. It was late 3! You were just a late bloomer and weren‚Äôt ready yet‚Äù. When I told her how I would cry and meltdown in too loud places she said, ‚Äúall kids do that. There‚Äôs nothing wrong you. You even graduated from university early and made it into graduate school. I‚Äôm a good mother and always got you what you needed. When you needed a reading tutor, science tutor, and swim instructors I did my best. You‚Äôre not disabled‚Äù. 

Just the way my mom said this is like there is a picture frame on the wall, and she can see it clearly but there is a tarp preventing me from seeing it. 

I don‚Äôt know if I even have autism, but when I google it is so scary how things fit what I‚Äôm feeling. I‚Äôm scared to see a doctor about it because it will make it like official if I do. I still see a pediatrician because my doctor wants to still see me. The nurses said my doctor sees certain patients until they‚Äôre a little older, and I‚Äôm just confused now. I want to ask my pediatrician what he thinks and a referral, but a part of me is scared to know. 


TLDR: My partner thinks I have autism and now I do to. Obsessed with water, struggle in social interactions, didn‚Äôt start speaking until 4, wouldn‚Äôt respond to my name and got hearing tests done, get upset in loud crowded areas frequently, and struggle.

Severely autistic daughter (advice post),"So my daughter is four. Due to some serious health and personal issues that I had last year, she didn‚Äôt get started in school until this week (which is super late, I know, but I‚Äôm a single mom and survival was our priority for the entirety of last year...I was bedridden for a portion of last year and couldn‚Äôt even leave my house for weeks at a time). It did not go well. My daughter is very prone to violent outbursts, primary directed inward (she bites herself, slaps, punches, and hits herself and sometimes others any time she‚Äôs angry or not given her way), and throws things, slams herself and objects around...you get the picture. I‚Äôm taking ownership and acknowledging that a major portion of that is more behavioral than autism related, because she has gotten accustomed to getting her way and during the worst of last year, ruled the roost so to speak. She‚Äôs a delight to be around when she‚Äôs happy but if she‚Äôs not, she‚Äôs difficult to endure...it breaks my heart but that‚Äôs literally what it becomes...enduring. I myself have ASD but I was raised by neurotypical and very strict parents who believed in severe corporal punishment. I don‚Äôt believe in spanking or hitting but even if I did, it seems like it would be entirely ineffective because she leaves herself covered in bruises when she gets spun up. She‚Äôs VERY intelligent and loving but can be manipulative and sneaky. I guess I‚Äôm looking for advice. Taking things away doesn‚Äôt help.

I think my mom has high functioning autism?,"Before I come off like a complete utter jerk, let me explain...

I didn‚Äôt really know my mother growing up. I was at school, and after school she worked second shift in a plastic factory. But I knew there was always something vastly different about her than other moms. She worked on cars. She didn‚Äôt dress like a girl. She built and fixed things around the house. And when it came to her kids, they were the least of her care. I didn‚Äôt even really know what good morning meant until I was 4 years old. My mother was one of the first people born 3 months early who made it. She was either 2 or 3 pounds when she was born. They had her in one of the first incubators when she was born in D.C. her father was a head accountant for General Electric. She was a ‚Äútroubled child‚Äù, claims to have been thrown out of the house at 16 and never looked back per say. I never really knew my grandparents because of it.

But my mom is smart, she‚Äôs very smart, but only when it comes to cars. She can tell you the same story about what she‚Äôs going to do on her car for 2 weeks before she actually does it, and when she does do it, it takes less time for her to do it than she spent talking. When it comes to empathy compassion or social behaviors it‚Äôs like that part of her brain is shut off. As a kid, I feel I didn‚Äôt really understand, because she‚Äôs all I knew, so how could a different parent be any better? 

I love my mother with my whole heart, but she‚Äôs spent more time talking to me about cars, working on her cars, and all her other projects than caring what I was going to do with the rest of my life. She was one of the first people diagnosed with ADHD and put on Ritalin in the world through Hofstra university in Long Island. Now I am 27, and it has almost been 10 years since I have been out of high school, and most of that has been spent with her or at our family home doing whatever was needed to be done. She yelled, a lot, barely listened, and then accused me of not being there, helping out, or listening. I know this is a strange thing to talk about, and I feel bad reaching out online, but I feel like this would just be too selfish and too annoying to talk about with anyone I know. I can go on and on about why and how and what brought me to this conclusion, I‚Äôm just looking for input of what I should or could do. I no longer live with her because my parents split up this year and I‚Äôm just not sure what or how much more of her I can handle, considering I spent most of my teenage and young adult life being with her every day until she had work.

Relationship help?,"Before I begin: I am polyam and have two partners. Primary is in her 40's while Secondary and I are same age mid 20's.


Yes I know my primary partner is on the spectrum but her and I are very similar and she's a constant trove of knowledge and intelligent conversation.

My secondary partner, who is best friends with my primary, despite being lovely and very sweet, is as stunned as a doorstop. Everyone said we should be together because of many similar interests and ""we're both writers and poets"". Which, sure we have some things in common and yeah she DOES write. But she's writing at a grade-middle school level and I'm at a 12th grade-university level. And, having mature, adult conversation with her is like chewing tinfoil as you have to explain things constantly. (Which I hate. I say things once and once only. She's in school to become a teacher so it's not like she's stupid.)

Her parents were told ""She's a retard and will never be anything; try again."" Mine were too. Difference is her parents just neglected her/used her as cheap maid service.  Mine did too but they also did everything in their power to make me normal. (Thankfully because I rather enjoyed getting an education. The only reason my secondary is in school is because her family is rich enough to afford it and she runs herself ragged to be normal so they let her attend.)

I really like her; she's brilliant and kind and always tries her best. She takes interest in what I say and tries to follow along. She's genuine and is a ray of sunshine in my day. But I feel like I'm beating myself to a snot trying to communicate with her at a level she understands. She's not stupid by any means so it really frustrates me that this seemingly super bright woman needs to have things dumbed down. (We're similar enough that we're all convinced that had her parents pushed normalcy on her the way mine did me, she'd be more on my level and not struggle as much.)

"Does anyone else feel like when they socialize, it will never be the same as when a neurotypical socializes?","The other day my roommate and I were talking - things were getting kind of uncomfortable so I wanted to ask her what was wrong - and we got on the topic of how we're different. ""Yeah, we're different,"" she said, ""Me - I like making people smile."" 

And I know she has a hard time with words so I tried not to get offended. ""Do you think I don't like making people smile?"" 

She waffles for a second and goes ""Well its just different. I like making strangers smjle - like the other day I held the door open for this guy - "" and then she goes on to explain small talk and being polite and friendly to people. I told her that I do this all the time, I chat with people at our dining hall and classmates, I hold doors, I smile, I say hi... She told me ""its different."" 

I've been struggling lately because, despite having had many deep conversations with the other people in our suite (stuff about affirmative action, depression, sexuality, anxiety, politics, family, what we're studying) all of them only ever come into our room to say hi to her, and they pretty much ignore me. My roommate told me its because I dont ""reach out enough"", despite me complimenting and asking our suitemates how they are pretty consistently, as well as texting occasionally.

Relationship issues ‚Äî I need an autistic perspective,"I have been officially diagnosed with:
Bipolar and ptsd, amongst a few different physical health conditions.I‚Äôm currently working, which isn‚Äôt great for my health. I‚Äôm doing far too much for my own good.

My partner has autism and ptsd.

I spent all morning cleaning the because he‚Äôs really struggling with functioning right now. Bc I‚Äôm the only one cleaning, some times the dishes pile up. There is more than what will fit beside the sink so I put a tea towel down on the bench and put some clean dishes on that to dry. I am tired, got no mental spoons and in a lot of pain. It‚Äôs hard for me to do all the cleaning.

I forgo having what I wanted for lunch, so I can go get him what he wants. While at the shop I get really overwhelmed because I asked for a day off next week, and While I was told I had it I didn‚Äôt actually get it off.

I get home, and he starts cooking ‚Äî without moving the items. That‚Äôs fine, I‚Äôll just move them. I duck in and In a gentle voice I‚Äôm just like ‚Äòoop, sorry, just let me quickly move these so I don‚Äôt have to rewash them :)‚Äô

But... that was the wrong thing to do. He melts down. In his words, later he I should let him get his plate and told him about it.

But in my experience, if I had done that, they would have sat there for longer and I would have to rewash the dishes.

I ask him what happened. he makes a impolite caricature of my voice, implying I yelled at him about rewashing the dishes. His voice is tense. His hands are balled up. He is swearing at me.

Trying any specific tactic that doesn‚Äôt come naturally will make the act much harder than it needs to be.,"I'm under the impression that many things that come off natural for most (i.e. those who aren't autistic), are the kind of things that require extra effort for autistics to do.

For example, I was reading something about how when people flirt and date, that it was repetitively said that people have to ""be themselves.""

but, I found a good quote that we might want to adopt:

*""Trying any specific tactic that doesn‚Äôt come naturally will make the act much harder than it needs to be.""*

source: https://www.zoosk.com/date-mix/single-life/flirting/how-to-flirt-with-a-girl/

I decided to also have the quote from that page be the title of this post.

somehow it just makes more sense to back off if you see perceived examples of ""extra-effort for autistics"" type things as less important than getting your own life in order.  For me, myself comes first.  I estimate dating to be too expensive for my lifestyle, and it's more than just TOO EXPENSIVE, it overwhelms me.

I don't have the nerve to carry on conversations without taxing comfort in the environment, so naturally I let others have a turn if I ""freeze up"".  But then others dominate and I have no chance at all.

I've even been in situations where my crushes focused more on the wingmen who said ""they want you"", or something like that.  makes no sense at all.

Doing research for a character with autism in YA fiction book.,"Hello all, I am a twice published YA fiction author of a sci-fi series, and for the fourth installment I intend to include a MAIN CHARACTER who has autism. I have four years experience as a caregiver to various students with autism and I believe I can portray a character with respect and accuracy that is not based directly on any one of these individuals. But, I would still like to verify with parents and various ASD folk that my representation is respectful and accurate. I would appreciate input. 

I am not out to portray an idealistic world or one that focuses entirely on the character‚Äôs autism. He has his other goals pertaining to the rest of the plot and he does not focus on his autism as a hindrance but a strength. 

In early scenes I portray him as mostly non verbal from an early age, and his father figure uses truth statements to teach him to respond. ‚ÄúIf my words are true for you, will you say them?‚Äù This is followed by guided phrases like ‚ÄúI am cold‚Äù and ‚ÄúI am hurt‚Äù. The father figure interchanges words and if the word isn‚Äôt true the child will not say it. 

Two of the individuals I worked with were mostly non verbal, one used a typing board with his mother interpreting. And the other could answer yes, no, or with simple phrases to direct questions. This fictional character will grow to be more verbal over the course of the book.

Is this an okay way of bringing up/describing Autism?,"I'm sorry if this isn't really okay to ask here but I was really hoping to get some opinions on something I had been working on as I don't want to be in a position where I offend someone or say the wrong thing.  


I want to start by saying that I do not know my official diagnosis, it's a long story but my personal doctor believes I am on the spectrum and it is very possible but I have no way of finding out what my results were and can't afford new testing now that I am an adult. 


I do however have an officially diagnosed son with Autism. The diagnosis is fairly new to him but is something we had known since he was very young. Aside from the initial confusion of the word, he proudly owns it and has no problem bringing it up to people he talks to. 


I've been working on a comic series (think newspaper strip rather than superhero) since 2018 that I have used as a way to handle real life situations and things on my mind. A little girl and her stuffed elephant - She questions the world and he helps her see the world differently by his answers. Purely a personal comfort. 

I have brought up things like stimming in the past in a positive way but wanted to bring up the topic of Autism directly. 


I was hoping someone might be able to take a look at what I had sketched and just confirm whether or not it's handled properly and if there is something I should do differently. Thank you so much for your time!

How to get close to my autistic brother?,"Hello everyone. 

I'm a 24 year old guy with a 23 year old brother with highly functioning autism. Throughout my childhood I felt sad about the fact that me and my brother were so close agewise, yet so far apart in our relationship. Due to my brother's lack of social interest and different way of behaving, we never really bonded and have never had a real friendship. Our talks are always short (a few sentences exchanged) and mostly about movies, which is pretty much the only common interest we share.

Now that my brother has become more mature, I feel like he is really making an effort to strike up conversations and interacting more socially. This has moved me and I have found a new love for my brother, as I feel like he actually cares about our relationship. I am trying to build a relationship to my brother, but I know that social interacting can be difficult for people with autism. So my question is, how can I develop a better relationship with him? I feel sad for him sometime since he has no friends or girlfriend and he has dealt with some depression. Over the last few years I have really enjoyed being with him, since he seems to be more interested and not just aloof on his computer like he used to. I have invited him to the movies and bowling sometimes and this is a activity that we enjoy, since we don't need to hold a conversation and can just enjoy the activity together. How can I know if my brother likes doing these things, or if he would perhaps rather be alone (since social interaction is difficult) or should I keep trying to bond and develop a friendship?

3. Repetitive work (doing a worksheet and just doing questions over and over again)
4. I sit sandwiched inbetween people 
5. Nobody to talk to (for me, sitting next to a friend can be a distraction at times but also keeps me awake)

I'm guessing this is because of too much stimulation  because of the light and the sound. 

When this happens, I end up staring blankly at the the thing I need to focus on and forget I'm there. I don't know how long I'm gone for but if I had to guess I'd say around a minute. This wouldn't be as problematic if it didn't take me a while to remember what I need to be doing (usually It will take a bit of time to find the question I was on).

I also noticed that I can get distracted very easily and zone out when doing things I don't enjoy but I don't think these two things are related. 

I'm still unsure about calling this a shutdown because in the end I always manage to force myself out of it but if it is caused by sensory problems could it still be zoning out?

Autism Color Wheel,"Autism is often described as a spectrum, and there's a common misconception that its a spectrum from ""low"" to ""high"" functioning, often with an implication that ""high functioning"" is closer to being ""normal"" or ""allistic passing"" and therefore ""better"". I've often seen that a better and more accurate way to describe the autistic spectrum is like a color spectrum.

What if we took that idea one step further?

Autism is like a color wheel, and the various types of traits could be represented by specific colors on the wheel, and whatever traits you have the most of is what ""type"" of autistic you are. Most people would probably be a mix of a couple colors, (blue-violet, yellow-green, etc) or maybe even a full rainbow. 

I just think it would be a lot cooler and better if we could be like ""yeah I'm a red autistic"" or ""I'm blue"" or ""I have green autism"" instead of ""I'm high/low functioning."" I think it would be more accurate, and more positive. There's no inherent negative connotations for colors. Plus it's just fun.",autism,1582421252,gwynrose,10,1,True,2020-02-22

I feel so awful right now :'(,"A few days ago, I (F16) was with a very close friend and his group of friends whom I know a lot less. I met them by chance so I stayed with them for a while. Only my close friend knows I have Asperger syndrome.
After a few minutes, they made a joke about people with autism.
I'm so used to this that I wonder if I deserve it. Honestly, I have been in hell and back since I was 10 years old. I am used to feeling persecuted by others, by unforeseen events or sensory stimuli.

I hate him. I feel so awful now. Most of the time I internalize everything but I can have periods of ""crisis"". More precisely because of the times when I try to adapt to others, try to look perfectly normal or internalize all my feelings for...really too long.
Now because of that I feel this feeling that I know by heart. I feel so fucking disgusting that I can't even speak to anyone anymore. I'm too ashamed of myself. I no longer feel like a human being and I stay in my bed or I run for hours in the rain to still feel something.

I don't know what to do with myself. I don't even know who I am anymore. Many people wonder why I am so discreet and why I hardly let anyone get close to me.

Autistic struggling with foodstuff,"I posted this in another community as well!

I really want to eat better (less sugar, more protein and veggies). How do I find healthy foods that I can tolerate when it‚Äôs extremely hard for me to find foods that I like in the first place? If I don‚Äôt like how something tastes, I physically cannot eat it even if I try to force myself to or else I will throw up. Right now I have already significantly reduced the junk food I eat and limit myself to fast food once maybe twice a week, but I avoid it as much as I can (it‚Äôs hard though!) I don‚Äôt mind eating the same foods I have been eating, but I am going to start training at the gym to build muscle and I know the amount of food I eat (I usually end up not eating enough in the day) as well as the kind of food I eat won‚Äôt help me reach my goal body. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

*I didn‚Äôt mean to type out every single food I eat but I love making lists and I got carried away and wrote my entire personal menu, sorry!*

The foods I eat to give you an idea in case you are interested: yogurt, some fruits, some cereals, chicken noodle soup without chicken pieces in it but with added potatoes, boiled or mashed potatoes, chicken, hamburgers (I have been eating these less though), the occasional hot dog, French fries (no ketchup), turkey and cheese sandwiches, popcorn, lettuce, spinach, very rarely tomatoes, rice with beans, tortilla chips either plain, with salsa, or with guacamole salsa (sometimes I make shredded chicken nachos with lettuce, shredded cheese and beans), pb&amp;j occasionally, pork chops sometimes, avocados, fresh guacamole, boiled eggs, vegetable fried rice (only occasionally though because it comes from the Chinese food place), spaghetti, meatballs sometimes, fish filets very rarely (salmon and tilapia only, but I don‚Äôt want to eat fish that much anymore because I don‚Äôt support the fishing industry and how much plastic they put in the ocean), gummy fruit snacks, sometimes I eat cookies and cake and ice cream but I control those portions very well
Fast food: (I am also working on cutting out fast food for the most part and have greatly reduced the amount of times I eat out!) McDonald‚Äôs (a mcchicken 99% of the time, a kids meal with nuggets the other 1%), Wendy‚Äôs (a 4for4 with a burger and sweet and sour sauce for the nuggets), Subway (6‚Äù either ham or roasted chicken, with cheese, spinach, lettuce, green peppers, onions, and sweet onion sauce), Taco Bell (either 2 or 3 tacos with lettuce and hot sauce or a chicken quesadilla), and general convenience fast food is chicken tenders with honey mustard
Drinks: water mostly, lactose free milk coming at a close second, but when I want something else I drink fruit punch, lemonade, Gatorade, or ginger ale for soda",autism,1582424095,televisionbodies,4,1,True,2020-02-22

High Functioning here with a warning to neurotypicals. Don't piss off Aspies. Story in the text.,"So my landlord has been rather negligent because he THINKS he can get away with it. Outside city limits and the county will do nothing unless it's a ""nuisance"" property. The problems in question? Mold and a falling cabinet over my sink. The landlord's been given multiple chances to fix it. But despite plumbing and electrical problems, placement of a drywall up against a porcelain toilet, etc, he will do nothing to help with the problems.   


He then had the audacity to raise my rent 25 bucks a year 3 years in a row, higher than the inflation rate, AND renege on our deal for cable and internet (I paid extra for the net, cable was supposed to be included).  


Thing is, this guy thinks that just because I have Autism that it means I can be taken advantage of. This is where the reason you don't piss off Aspies comes into play.  


I had enough so I started to look at my options. I looked at all my local services. I started digging through codes. I found out HUD offers tenant-based assistance. You have a place, they INSPECT it, and if it passes they'll help you pay. If it DOESN'T, you're bumped up the list and moved on the city's dime, especially if you have a disability (I have 2). Oh, and they shut down the property if it's a health hazard. Check and mate. He's going to lose that property, and I'm going to be moved and save money, rather than paying this psychopath 525 dollars a month for an efficiency apartment out of 781.  


And this is why you do not piss us Aspies off. We will put up with a lot, because we do have trouble with confrontation. But you push us enough, and we will look for our options and proceed to dismantle everything around you, and you won't notice until it blows up in your face. We don't wish to cause a ripple.

My Brother whom I love unconditionally,"Hi all,

Not sure if this is the correct reddit sub so apolgies beforehand to admins if this does not belong. I have a 14 year old autistic brother, he does not communicate with me or my family at all, has recently been removed from school, and everyday my concern has grown for him. I am 24 years old, a recent college grad and working in financial services. My parents whom are both near 60 years old, my mother is the breadwinner and my father spends every day taking care of my younger brother. 

I worry everyday for my brother, he has been removed from school since the summer of 2019 as he turned 14. The previous school he was attending will not let him attend as it is only meant for those under the age of 14. Because of this, trying to attend a different school has been difficult. Because of the changes made, my brother refused to go onto the school bus that picks him every single day. To remedy this, my father would drive him personally to school, however my brother refused to enter the building. The school had tried different strategies to be able to lead him in the school but it has been no help. A social worker provided a ""teacher"" to come to my family's home 3 days per week for roughly 2 hours to ""educate"" my brother. However even with this there has been no help. It is currently Feb 2020 and my brother has been out of a school system for months.

As time goes on, I worry for my parents. My mother, despite being the bread winner is nearing retirement soon. My father, unemployed takes care of the house and my brother, but I can see it has taken a toll on him. I'm worried he has simply lost motivation and hope.for my brother. My father and I have a unique relationship, I know he's strong and tends to never show his softer side. I've had a talk with my father about my brother's future and he simply has told me, ""One day a time.""

Every day I see my brother have temper tantrums, not making any progress in his communication skills, and being idle all day. I know life is difficult but I worry for his future. I'm scared of him being put in a group home. I want to know what he is thinking about. I want him to know that he has a mother and father and a brother that love him despite his condition.

Autism and politics; do ND people tend to lean one way more than the other?,"I‚Äôve read that people with autism typically hate lying, though they themselves might do it at times.

Just curious what everyone‚Äôs thoughts are; I don‚Äôt care what your political ideology may or may not be as it does not change the essence of who we are. But, if who we are shapes the way we are likely to sway, that would at the very least be quite notable and very interesting.

Edit: the fact that somebody was so quick to downvote kind of upsets me. People with autism can have opinions too, in fact, perhaps the whole reason I feel so strongly about social injustice and rectify the problems of the world could be the fact that I myself am ND.

Genuine question (fictional characters),"I've noticed a trend on some social media websites where people headcanon fictional characters from TV shows, movies, video games, cartoons, etc. as on the autistic spectrum. There's nothing wrong with that, and certain characters really do show traits of autism. Maybe the creators even wrote them that way as a hint they're autistic. 

But my question is more about characters that *don't* show any traits of autism and yet are labeled as such by some fans. *Please* don't take my question as an attack against those who have autism. I don't have a problem with autistic characters, and it's nice for people of all walks of life to see someone like them as superheroes and genuinely cool characters.

Self taught pianist and composer here!,"In mid 2012 my grandmother bought my mother a digital piano because she used to play and whenever I went to my mums house, I would go on the piano. I didn't think much of it at the time and I wasn't trying to learn how to play but apparently they saw potential in me. I became obsessed with it and one day they offered to let me take it home so I could play on it more often and I used to play it about 5 hours a day. There was never a point where I thought wow i'm learning to play piano, my motivation was classical music. I loved beethoven, bach and mozart and I wanted to write music like them so I would come up with pieces of music and publish them online. I soon started to get a following and people would ask me to compose more and I would film myself playing. I released an album on spotify and 8 years later I still love playing. I find it helps my anxiety and I no longer feel nervous to play infront of people. Whenever I walk past a public piano, I dive on it and play a beethoven sonata which sometimes attracts a crowd and I love it :p

Decreasing therapy for my 6 year old daughter,"I have lurked here for a long time and now have a scenario I'd like some feedback about.

My daughter is 6 and since she was diagnosed as autistic with a developmental delay two and a bit years ago, it's been non-stop therapy, early intervention classes, medical appointments, and activities with a therapy base or therapeutic approach.

She recently started school and has some fantastic support there.

Due to factors outside of my control her formal therapy has declined significantly.  And honestly, I've not seen much of a difference in her, except that she seems a lot happier and much more relaxed.  I feel like I'm getting to know her as a person and have completely moved out of the problem-solving mindset I've been stuck in since she was diagnosed.  I didn't even realise I was seeing it that way til now. 

I floated this idea with another parent I'm close with and they were aghast at the idea I might move her to maintenance level therapy at this age instead of returning to multiple intensive therapies.  

Also I know I won't get another chance at funding for early intervention for her as the cut-off is age 7 where I am.

A year ago I found out about autism (mainly asperger's) and was reading up on it and it felt like I was reading a biography, but I didn't want to self diagnose. I felt really helpless because I didn't have access to a medical professional at the time. 
I have struggled with depression since I was a kid and when you don't have the opportunity to discover what your lifelong issues are, you feel beyond hopeless... It got so bad to the point where I experienced my first catatonic episode. I felt so lifeless, feeling absolutely nothing to the point where I couldn't even think. 
My mom was really concerned, saying I had no light in my eyes, I was so far gone from everything, I detached myself from my own being at that point.
I got hospitalized soon after and was talking to a few mental health professionals, the whole process was exhausting and annoying, this was in late November.
When I was finally released I was introduced to my psychologist, and she has changed my life.. She is a neurologist as well and goes in depth with what causes any issues I am struggling with, which I love instead of a stereotypical therapist telling me to look on the bright side (yes I experienced that a few years ago). 
I was telling her about my thoughts on autism and she proceeded to do some testing and went over it with me, telling me my results weren't very surprising on her behalf, she diagnosed me soon after. 
I felt... Relieved to know the answer but also very frustrated at the same time, mainly because I'm diagnosed when I'm almost 20 years old. I got the answer I wanted yet I still have that hopeless feeling deep down. I don't want to offend anyone when I say that it's just so shocking to me that I am actually autistic and just now finding out about it.
Will it get better to cope with it? Is it normal to be upset with myself about this? I have so many questions to the point where I don't even know what to ask.",autism,1582503045,tubbsbutsad,4,1,True,2020-02-23

Crash course in kids,"Sorry if this is the wrong sub to post this in, delete if this is the case.

"Trying to find reliable resources, methods or coping mechanisms to help my girlfriends kid (8yrs) with coping with school, social life","The title says it all really but for a bit of background info, my girlfriends kid (P) though a very normal kid has very certain tells that she is leaning towards the autistic scale.

I'm not sure if everything I'm writing is the correct way to address stuff so sorry in advance if I unintentionally offend anyone.

Her dad's brother and mother both have autism and after a good heart to heart with him he finally admitted P has got definite traits associated with autism and in previous years there didn't seem to be an effect her social skills, grades and general life but with going into junior school in 2019 we have started to notice things happening more and more which are starting to get in the way of her wanting to be a kid that wants to have fun.

Her teacher has also said about when we have parents evening in the next 3/4 weeks that we should discuss organizing a test to see where she is on the spectrum (if she is) but this test might take up to 6-10 months for the initial test and if deemed necessary then she will be put on the waiting list to see some specialist doctor and that could take up to 3 years apparently and we do not have the finances to go private so which leads me posting on here.

I tried to look up some online resources but a lot of them referred it akin to a disease but I believe its just an alternative thought process and I want to help find ways to help her thought process so she can learn to not stress at school so much and be more confident to play with other kids as it's heart breaking for us to see her come home and cry because she says she has no friends anymore.

Maybe its all flared up because she has had a crap first half term and after this week off it will be better as she has kinda had a week to chill out (been very ill though whole week so not been able to go play with the kids around the houses which sucked) but I really think we need to do more to help her develop and be herself again.

And side note as well she is not being bullied in anyway as I know the parents of some of the older years and they haven't gone and played with her but have kept and eye out on her and she knows she can go to those kids for help if the teachers wouldn't do anything",autism,1582504456,bearsandbarbells,8,1,True,2020-02-23

Does this foreign girl like me?,"I have Aspergers and I'm in college. I am 19 and met a girl my age last year. Her family is from another country called Montenegro. They all seem to keep to themselves and don't talk much to people or hangout with people outside of school. They are all aloof and serious you don't see them smile much. 

We had a college version of show and tell and there was an older student that was 39 that had a pic of her and her boyfriend. I said ""I want to see so I know what I'm competing with"" the whole class laughed and the girl laughed really hard she laughed the loudest. Shortly after that I started just talking to her casually. I noticed people will say hi to her and she just ignores them. I asked her a question about herself and she answered it in class with a smile but seemed like she wasn't comfortable or something. As soon as I sat down in class one day and the 39 year old woman sat down I asked her on how to not lead a girl on. There was a special Ed girl that's 2 years younger than me that messaged me everyday trying to talk to me saying hi. Then started asking if I was dating. I asked how to not lead her on. Well she said her piece and a bunch of people gave advice and she said in a louder tone than she usually talks in telling me to just ignore her don't even respond to the message when at first suggested to tell her I'm not interested. Then told me to pretty much ignore that girl that messages me and not even engage with her. Then one day we had peer reviews she came and sat down between me and the 39 year old woman. She had her back to her the whole time and was trying to make conversation with me but was awkward. She asked me for my birthday. At one point she just said something forced a smile and rested her hand on her head while holding long eye contact with me and I got a vibe she was flirting with me just didn't know what to do. She talks in a softer tone with me than most people. She saw me in the hall and said hi and asked what's up when I didn't even see her. That's actually a big deal for her.  One day I sat at a table next to the older woman and she came in waiting for class she started pacing around me and walking in front of me and I could smell her perfume. She was in my personal space and had her back to me. It was an empty room and she started getting a little close because all I could smell is her. She smiled in class when I joked around. She asks questions showing she listens to me and shows interest in me. 

I stopped having class with her because the semester ended. She saw me in the hall waiting and stopped to talk to me and had a bunch of makeup on when she rarely wears it. She had the biggest smile on her face and asked me how my classes were. I told her my advisor said he was going to kick me out because he knows I smoke pot she said ""awww"" in a tone. I asked her how her classes were and it went right over her head. I was walking on a path and we crossed paths she couldn't look me in the eyes and said hey very softly. A day later we had an assembly in the biggest lecture hall and it was half full. She came in and saw where I was sitting. She sat next to the 39 year old woman I paid a lot of attention to, but an empty seat away from me and between us so I couldn't see the woman. Then she smiled at another guy when he said something that wasn't funny. 

I waited a while then one day got her number. I went up to her and asked if I could talk to her in another room. She had the biggest look of shock on her face I could tell she was nervous. Then I told her I miss seeing her and asked if I could have her number. She said yeah sure and gave it but made no eye contact during this interaction even though I was looking at her. I texted her and said I'd like to get to know her and asked her if she'd like to do it over text or phone she said whatever you'd like. I would text her here and there. Eventually she got back to me because I pretty much said if you want nothing to do with me I'll leave you alone. She said omg no and told me she saw my messages but forgot to respond and she works a llt. She's weird when it comes to texting and it's like she doesn't know what to say and says stuff that sounds forced and unnatural. I sent her a friend request on Facebook and she declined it, seems like she only has it for school and work. She's friends with one of my friends on Facebook but they were in the same major and he didn't even talk to her. She was still texting me after she declined my friend request.

Can‚Äôt seem to keep a job,"TLDR: how does someone w aspergers keep a job for more than like two months?

I just fired today from a job that I absolutely loved as a teachers aide. Specifically, a special ed/1:1 TA. Rather than helping in general, I worked with one particular kid that had a different curriculum/needs than her typical classmates.

I hate to admit it, but the reason is a couple weeks ago‚Äîbecause I was getting over a cold and had just started a new medication‚ÄîI started falling asleep on the job. This was while my student was in physical/speech therapy, so she had two adults plus her nurse with/supervising her. Regardless, this was a safety violation on my part and resulted in my being fired today.

I explained the medication side effects I had experienced (which have since calmed down, at least the fatigue part), but still took full responsibility for my actions the day of the incident and today. (I was fired today because the incident happened just before February break.)

My boss seemed remorseful about the decision but understandably still enforced the school‚Äôs zero tolerance policy. Even as I was leaving I asked if my student‚Äôs parents were aware I would no longer be working with her (they are but not as to why) and if she would be okay. My boss knew that I loved my job and only wanted to succeed and do right by the students.

This wasn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôd committed a safety violation but this was the most egregious. However I had been fully open about my diagnosis and my supervisors were very helpful and understanding.

I‚Äôm so embarrassed, I would never purposely put a student in danger and I was even thinking of getting a masters degree in special ed (or some kind of formal training if there were something more affordable).

This isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve lost a job due to piled up little mistakes (and then one big mistake) and I‚Äôm scared it won‚Äôt be the last. I don‚Äôt know why I can‚Äôt seem to keep a steady job for more than a couple of months but I need to figure this out somehow. I think I‚Äôm lacking in soft skills but I don‚Äôt know which ones. I feel like I don‚Äôt act professional enough and being too much of my genuine self to work but I don‚Äôt know how to create/filter the me at work vs the me in daily life.

I‚Äôm so embarrassed and heartbroken and frustrated, and I don‚Äôt know what to do next. I‚Äôm looking for local resources that might help me get/keep a job and trying to find resources online although a lot of sites to help ppl w autism find work are directed at teens. I hate how hard it is to find help for autistic adults, never mind autistic adult women for that matter. One local resource I found does help autistic adults get work but it‚Äôs mostly at like dollar stores and such. Which is fine but I have a bachelors degree, I can do more than that.

My husband says I should take today to just be sad and tbh all this crying has me tired so maybe he‚Äôs right. He also wants to meet with my boss to try and advocate for me which could, in my opinion, come back to haunt me.

So reddit folks I believe that in order to better serve a community one must understand the needs of the group you are trying to serve. Hence why I am here asking what you are looking for in an item of stim jewellery. The one in the link is specifically an asexual design but the beads slide and rotate freely and it's what I would call a ""quiet"" design. Would you want a bracelet to serve such a purpose and what would you be looking for if I were to make and design some bracelets / jewellery to serve the neurodiverse community?

He falls asleep easily, but after about 2-3 hours into his sleep, on his own bed, he gets up. We put him back to sleep, and he can sleep for half an hour to an hour... Then we put him down again and this time gets shorter and shorter... 20 min, 10 min...

So, let's say he sleeps at 8 pm, around 10pm he is either moving quite some, or he gets up. We put him to sleep, he sleeps till 10h30-11h00... Put him down, he sleeps till 11h20-11h45, when normally we are already in our bed.

Then he just gets up and cones to our bed and sleep here.

Anyone had their kid not be able to sleep through the night and was able to fix this? This lack of sleep is taking a heavy toll on both him and us

Security Objects: an Exploration of Comfort Items,"*looks at title and shakes head*

Yeah, I have a knack for presentation which I still have to get under control, but I'm not here to wax lyrical about my eccentricities, rather I'm seeing what everyone uses as a security object.

For example, mine has changed a couple times where I would actually use a person as my security object, then I found a small plush toy called a ""Smelly Belly"" which I have since discovered are relatively rare collectors items, and finally settling on a toy given as part of a work place Christmas gift from my job... a small plush toy of Rooty the Great Root Bear of A&amp;W.

I am 50y male and I suspect I am on the spectrum.," I was diagnosed about 15 years ago with PTSD, Bipolar, and OCD.  At the time, the doctors told me they were diagnosing me with bipolar because it allowed them the greatest freedom in prescribing medications that would help me. 
 I have a vague memory from 1977, when I was 8, of a doctor saying something to my mom about Asperger's.  I was going through a long period of severe separation anxiety.  I couldn't bear being apart from my mother for even a minute.  After a few weeks or months of this, I was admitted to a children's hospital and went though several days of testing from Psych evaluations to cat scans. At the end, I remember my mom arguing with a doctor about something to do with Asperger's.  I think my mom chose not to believe or for whatever reason rejected the diagnosis.  
I'm fifty years old now.  I want to know.  I don't exactly know where to go from here.  I want to know for sure whether or not this is who I am.
I found one doctor 2 hours away from me that specializes in adult autism, but he is not accepting new patients.
  I'm currently experiencing pretty bad anxiety attacks and don't really have any support system anymore.

Like I have nothing to do, you can only preoccupy yourself with homework and hobbies for so long. God I am so isolated, and lonely, and I have been for such a long time.

I have gotten better, like in my last few years of high school, I did not really have friends, but I did talk to people in class and stuff, and I was involved in clubs. I‚Äôm now in university, and I honestly really like school itself. I‚Äôm taking history and I love the subject, but I kinda lack the motivation to keep going.

I had a rough day today and I need to vent and I need advice,"My terrible day started pretty much began when I got out of bed. My older sister is super mean to me. She‚Äôs never nice, and I hate it. I don‚Äôt know what to do. My mom can also get pretty mean. They both yelled at me for no reason. Yelling is something I‚Äôm incredibly sensitive to. They seem to like it when I don‚Äôt get my way. They watch the Hallmark channel way too darn much. It‚Äôs annoying. My sister likes to blast the television just so I can scream because it‚Äôs too loud. I‚Äôm usually on the other side of my house compared to where they are at. 

Fast forward to this afternoon... I generally practice my trombone. My sister now had Freeform on and my mom didn‚Äôt watch the television because she had things to do. Smart by my mom to get the blood moving instead of sitting around. I get it, it‚Äôs Saturday, and my sister doesn‚Äôt want to do anything. When I began to blow my first notes through my mouthpiece, I suddenly assumed that the television was louder than before. I went out to my sister and asked her to turn the television down. Her response: ‚Äúdon‚Äôt play so loud.‚Äù My response: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm playing loud because that‚Äôs what the dynamic says on my sheet music.‚Äù I was playing mezzo-forte. She doesn‚Äôt believe in dynamics. I went back to practicing and I felt a little better. I got done what I needed to get done on my trombone. Music is healing! I‚Äôve had a lot of problems with my sister lately and I decided that I enough with that. I‚Äôm so sick of all the s**t I‚Äôve had to deal with. I began to have a meltdown and attempted to swipe the remote out of my sister‚Äôs hand. I wanted to listen to the weather on the news. It didn‚Äôt end well. My mom ran to me and got mad at me. She pulled my hair as well as my shirt, and she even pinched my butt. She even pushed me so hard. I screamed and started to cry. I was frustrated and I began to have a meltdown. I did a lot of hand flapping. The television was unplugged. I was hoping my sister would be punished. I just went to my room to watch my favorite show on Freeform on my laptop.  

After I had calmed down, I went to my basement to play the piano. I‚Äôve been working on my scales (Major, MM, HM), arpeggios, and inversions (root, 3rd, 5th, octave). As a college student who‚Äôs majoring in music, everything is so important to me. Music itself has been a huge part in my life. My family is full of musicians and it‚Äôs helped my autism so much. I was not focused and didn‚Äôt have a good practice session. I even had my headphones in. My mom hates it when I have them in my ears because she claims I have them in my ears too much. I have them in my ears to block out sound and I listen to music. 

My dad got home from work and I wanted to watch some NHL hockey, but my sister got mad again. All because I said I wanted to watch hockey. The television was unplugged. Sometimes I feel like my dad likes me more than my dad. I seem to think my mom and sister don‚Äôt understand my autism, and I think my dad does. My voice takes a long time to go back to normal after a meltdown. Everyone thinks I‚Äôm still yelling. I attempted to ask my dad about the television and he told me to ask my mom. I asked my mom and she told me to ask my dad. I screamed and I was flustered. I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I did a lot of deep breathing because I needed to after what I‚Äôve gone through today. I finally got my television back and I was happy. My sister was mad because she thought I should have been punished. Again my dad was gone throughout most of the day.

I can't deal,"So. I recently found out my older brother is Autistic. We are not close. I found out because I recently studied autism in college and he matches all the symtoms. 

The thing is, I grew up being abused by him and my mother. My mother has social anxiety issue, mental issues and PTSD as well. The entire family thought my brother was brilliant while I am ""stupid"". My dad avoided the family because my mother abuses him too mentally and constantly argue (they were bad for each other). My older brother was savant in school while we were little. His grades were good in HS, but failed in college because he was failing socially and couldn't coop. 

I have a feeling I'll end up being responsible for him. He doesn't even realize he's autistic. I realized because he has macrocephaly when he was little and he has all textbook symptom once I was leanring it. he was a pre-mature baby and everything. All we do when we are together is talk about our bad childhood, he likes to trash talk about mom or dad; and like, i don't care, we are adults now.

Is there any social help out there for adults autistic people? Or people with autism (whichever label you the reader prefer). He's totally in denial. We are in Texas. He thinks all his problem stems from Stockholm syndrome (we moved from China to America, and he hated it, he thinks our parents kidnapped him to America).

I really don't want to live with him or keep in touch with him because he mentally abused me bad when I was little;  But I have a feeling he'll kill himself or fail in life if I just let him be. Honestly I could just let him be because he wouldn't return call or text. He barely returns mom's phone calls. He refused to apply for SSI help (he has 1 deaf ear) because he's too prideful and he argues with everyone that tries to help him.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I should just let things be and i'll never see him again because we have such bad blood. He apologized but I wanted to just leave everything in the past. I could technically keep up the relationship just because I can be a nice person, but... it will definitely be a drain on me. I hated him, my child hood were terrible because of him.

I just want to see what resources out there for adults autistic people  or people with autism that was never diagnosed by doctors when they were children. He has no health insurrance.

Can anyone else relate to this?,"Hey everyone!

So I've been doing a lot of dumb creative writing in my free time lately, and I sort of came up with what I think is a good metaphor of how my Autism makes me feel in terms of emotions/empathy/expressing my feelings. It also I think can apply pretty well to depersonalization, so if you go through that as well you can hopefully relate to this. 

But anyway, this is first and foremost a metaphor for how Autism feels to me - in terms of emotional stuff and expressing emotional stuff - which I hope some of you guys can relate to!

It feels like, I'm a human brain - a fully functioning, self-aware, breathing, thinking, feeling human brain - that from the moment of birth, has been separated from my body and placed instead into a robot.

The brain is inside the robot to power it. Tell it what to do, where to go, and what to say. 

But! There's probes that connect the brain to the robot, so it can function. And while the brain controls the robot's motor functions (usually) as it would a natural human body, the internal machinery which allows the brain to command the robot, has a bunch of pre-coded filters. This way the brain can't make the robot say or do certain things it ""shouldn't"". If people knew that the robot was actually a human brain that's been shoved inside of a bunch of metal, they'd get the whole project shut down! So whoever made this thing, had these ""safety measures"" put in.

The brain might, for example, feel extremely happy! It might empathize with a person who's struggling through life, and feel an intense care and love toward that person!

But having a robot say all that, and express it, might fall into the Uncanny Valley. So, if the brain tries to tell a human being, ""I know how you feel, I go through it too!"" then the filters make it so that no words, and no emotions come out of the robot at all. Neither verbally or through body language. And try and try as the brain might to express that, the filters stop it from being able to actually pass it through to command the robot.

The brain might feel an intense mixture of emotions and try to tell people specifically how it feels and what got it there. But the filters stop it all from coming out, so the robot instead might start saying, ""I feel..."" and not be able to finish it. What the brain was trying to say might have been, ""I feel a sense of longing, coupled with morose, yet hopefulness"". But the filters again stopped all that from coming out.

Eventually the brain will, of course, get fed up with this. It'll try to express itself in ANY way it can! It might feel like it's going crazy from not being able to express itself. So it'll retaliate and hit itself, smash itself against a wall, do SOMETHING to feel a sense of control over the machine it's trapped in. All the while, it's trying to scream, ""PLEASE! SOMEONE! LISTEN TO ME! LISTEN TO WHAT I HAVE TO SAY!"" 

But all that ever comes out from the robot's voice box is harsh, grating feedback noise.

And when the brain finally calms down, and finally stops causing a big mess, people will look and say, ""Ugh, that robot's defective. Maybe someone should re-program it, or ban robots altogether.""

But they don't realize, it's not really a robot. It's a human being! A human being trapped inside of a machine with no way out, and no way to tell people that.",autism,1579435251,SomethinSp00kyHere12,2,1,True,2020-01-19

"We need a better word than ""meltdown""","I really think we need to collectively adopt a better word than meltdown to describe the autistic meltdown. For one thing even though it's a common situation autistic meltdowns have not been medically designated a term. I think it's time for this to change. 

And while this is the case I think ""meltdown"" is a terrible word to describe the circumstance given that it is typically a synonym for tantrum and as we all know autistic meltdowns are not tantrums. 

One reason I feel so strongly about this is because I lost a friendship due to my own series of meltdowns following my father's death. When I describe what I was experiencing as a meltdown my friend was disgusted and ceased communication with me, not understanding that it was something out of my control and not giving me the chance to explain. He assumed it was a childish choice to display a rageful tantrum and did not want to associate further. 

Meltdown is a terrible choice of words. I personally have thought about potential terms to use such as ""sensory overload attack"" or ""overstimulation attack"" or ""processing attack"". I like attack, not unlike panic attack, because I think it gets the feeling across well enough that people who aren't familiar with autism at least understand that we are not making a choice to be  inconvenient and childish until we get what they think we want.",autism,1579465903,Kendorable,33,1,True,2020-01-19

Advice wanted: 8 Year old ASD/ADHD partially verbal step-son is constantly making repetitive demands.,"I'm not sure if this is the right sub to ask for advice but I figure it's worth a shot. 

My partner's eight year old ASD son has started talking a lot more lately, which is outstanding and we are really encouraging of him using words to get what he wants. However with this has come a cycle of repetitive demands that he seems to get stuck in constantly until he is just sitting there asking for certain things non stop. 

We try to redirect his attention and distract him with things he enjoys but it doesn't seem to help. For example, recently we drove for five hours back from holiday and he asked non-stop for an iceblock, even though he had been given two at certain points along the way. 

I feel like I can see him trying to stop himself at times and it makes me feel really sorry for him that perhaps he is stuck in a battle with himself, fighting against what he knows he should be doing and what he needs to do impulsively. As someone who has suffered with motor tics for the last twenty years, I can sympathise with not being able to say no to bodily urges/tics.

What do you think my little brothers future might look like? He‚Äôs 4,"So some things he can do : 


*** Count to 50 ( a couple months ago when everyone thought he could only count to 20 I heard him by himself counting to thirty and even doing some 30s, so I guess he may have learned this by himself ?)


*** recognize some colors and shapes 


*** read some stuff. I don‚Äôt know the extent of this but earlier this year my dad had a suspicion he was able to read, low and behold I randomly gave him something at the supermarket ( right before turning 4 ) and he read the name to me. After a few months we know for sure he definitley can read some stuff. 


*** may be able to spell out his name, not sure but my dad said he could 


*** say the alphabet 


*** answer some questions that don‚Äôt require deep thought. For example, my dad can show him a pic of someone in our family and be like ‚Äú who‚Äôs that ‚Äú and he‚Äôll answer. 





Things he has trouble with: 



*** paying attention. He can‚Äôt seem to pay attention for more than 5-10 secs and doesn‚Äôt always respond to calling his name even if you do it loud. 



*** verbalizing what he wants. He‚Äôs getting better for sure but he won‚Äôt be like ‚Äú I want milk‚Äù. Though yesterday he wanted vegetable chips and walked around repeating ‚Äú vegetable chips ‚Äú for a few minutes 

*** interacting w people. 


*** some noises like the blender ( makes him cry / scream and run away ) 



*** talking , he can‚Äôt have a conversation cuz he can‚Äôt seem to say too many words Mx 

He sings to himself and babbles a lot ( like he says ‚Äú wa wa wa ‚Äú a lot, idk if he‚Äôs trying to talk and can‚Äôt . And interestingly enough today my dad asked him if he was ready to leave and he said ‚Äú yes‚Äù so that‚Äôs pretty cool.

Thoughts on a nonverbal 5 year old,"I cross posted something in another sub. 

I am not in a good place admittedly.

I  had suspicions that my son was autistic well before he was 1 year old. I  did push and got a diagnosis and started therapy before he turned two.  

He  is now almost 5 years old and has no words. He does understand what you are saying he just does not speak. We are getting an assisted  communication device to help him. He doesn't have any friends. He  doesn't try and play with other kids. His father is not involved.

I  know he is awfully young to predict his future (at least that is what I  told myself 4 years ago). But the reality is that not having speech before the age of 5 is bad for their independence as it means he will be  low functioning. All his therapists have told me that.

She does not look at me, she does not care for me for she is happy on her own. She is four years old with the serenity all of us are striving for.
 Pain and sadness rage through me when I think of the ignorant crossing her dancing path and seeing only everything they would change about her.
But as I hear her song and see her dance all of that disappears in my foggy subconscious and I join her in perfect harmony with myself. Almost miraculously she takes my hand to invite me to her beautiful planet.

"""Friend"" got mad at me for not picking up on his flirting. What do I do to prevent this in the future?","I've been hanging out with a new friend for the last 9 days and I was really happy because he's into all the niche media and humour that I'm into. I was starting to get a little bit of a crush on him but I wasn't sure what to do to move forward.

Then today he seemed to really get mad out of nowhere and told me that if I was going to reject him I shouldn't pussyfoot about it.

??????????

I got a bit spooked by his anger because I didn't see any of this coming, and words don't come easy to me in high stress situations so he just kind of ranted at me and left. He said stuff about how he's been flirting and dropping hints and I've just ignored them. Like I've said that I'm on the spectrum and stuff but he was still convinced that my lack of awareness was communicating disinterest somehow. 

He's blocked me on all everything so I guess reconciliation won't be possible. :( On the other hand he scared me a little, so maybe a relationship with him was a bad idea to begin with.

How do I tell if a guy is flirting with me? And are there any red flags that might help warn me when someone's going to get mad at me like that? His outburst seemed to come out of the blue but I'm sure there was body language/signs that I might have missed.

Sick of seeing prejudice against autism (rant),"Maybe it's just my area, and half the internet, but it seems like most people are vastly misinformed about autism and autistic people are suffering, and even dying, because of it. Worse, there doesn't seem to be much opportunity for change.

Are autistic people supposed to band together? How? They aren't visibly identifiable and have to remain unknown and try to blend in not to be bullied or outcast even as adults. Not to mention they don't tend to be clustered together like racial and religious groups can often be. You gonna gather together a bunch of easily overloaded people (who are pretty spread out to begin with) to march against riot cops? The standard courses of action in society fail entirely here. And before anyone starts any crap about NoT cArInG wHaT pEoPlE tHiNk, let's remember it has real world consequences when you can't get promoted, or get overloaded and lose your position, or can't get hired because the interview process can become too inhumane. Though people loathe to admit it (especially abusers), we are emotional machines, it takes a toll when everyone treats you badly. There are environments and tasks where autistic people actually thrive, and even outperform ""normal"" people, but they require treating your employee like a human who has feelings rather than a cog.  Then there's relationships. Mostly autistic people get to choose between people that will pity you but can't handle you for long, people who will take advantage of you, other socially unacceptable people (often with actual mental illnesses) or isolation, which they know plenty of and surely suffer psychological effects from. Add to all this an emotional system cranked to 11 and how is it even a puzzle that autistic people commit suicide at higher rates, and even die younger on average naturally? 

But hey, they're socially awkward, nobody likes that. You can't expect /everyone/ to change just to accommodate them, they need to fit in or screw 'em amirite? /s 

The change being asked for is an end to bullying of all kinds, at all stages of life, and equal opportunity based on merit of work rather than social skills. In my experience autistic people don't want to be socially awkward and welcome a certain degree of polite coaching. Nobody wants anyone to let the raging child take a bite out of anyone's leg except his Karen of a mother.  Also gonna go out on a limb and guess those holy terror children still get their fair share of abuse behind closed doors. If the parent is a total doormat they will likely let other abusive people into the household, and if not they probably wanna smack the kid too and probably do, which is not always as good of a learning tool as people hope. It can even make things worse, especially when you don't understand what you did wrong and just feel like your parents, teachers, and peers hate you for being born.

I saw a post that got an uncomfortable amount of traction, saying it should be ok to hate autistic people because of certain kids who aren't disciplined for violence, and it's their own fault for acting ""wrong"". But for every spoiled brat of an autistic child, whose parents can't figure out how to balance discipline and care and instead let the kid wreak unmitigated havoc, nobody seems to realize there are 10 who go their whole lives being pushed out of every opportunity and often abused heavily by family, friends, teachers, bosses, and coworkers because of ingrained social prejudices that are considered acceptable because ""It's how normal people know they can trust each other,"" and ""They're bringing it on themselves."" 

Except ""NORMAL"" PEOPLE CAN'T MAGICALLY TELL WHEN PEOPLE ARE TRUSTWORTHY, THEY JUST THINK THAT!  It's proven wrong constantly, every time a normal person trusts someone they shouldn't!   It has nothing to do with trustworthiness! It is a standard fear reaction to the unfamiliar, aka basic human prejudice. So even though autistic people are statistically more likely to be honest and trusting, to the point it often becomes the reason they get taken advantage of, their differences are used as an excuse to treat them like loose cannons who deserve to be denied every opportunity in life simply because they are socially awkward and ""I once knew a bratty autistic kid so my prejudice is justified"". Not to mention mommy's over-protection just translates to a lack of preparedness once adulthood rolls around, so yeah those kids are getting a huge advantage. /s

Also how the hell does anyone make the jump from ""They don't act the same,"" to ""They don't have feelings""? Pretty extreme assumption to make with ZERO EVIDENCE don't ya think? Nope, it's fine, just treat them like garbage, they can't feel anyhow. /s

For some other marginalized groups they say ""It gets better."" So far as I can tell, for autism it gets worse. I really wish it was easier to inform popular opinion. Unfortunately it is just that, popular, and autism is decidedly not. If you are an adult with autism who has a secure enough life that you can speak out, please do what you can to show people the other side to this. I know there are often gives and takes with it, and humanity would be worse off without some of the gifts it brings. Maybe with time they will learn that.

TLDR: THERE IS NO LOGICAL JUSTIFICATION FOR PREJUDICE AGAINST AUTISM. The stats don't match the popular sentiments.

Parent of a 8yo autistic,"Hi /r/autism !

My son is 8yo, been diagnosed at 5yo, but we had a hunch when he was three.

I am looking for ideas here, as a parent.

His main difficulty is his anxiety. Anything new or anything he hasn't done in a long time puts him in a state of very high anxiety. When he is in that state, he starts to be angry, say things that are very demeaning towards himself and sometimes slaps himself in the face. It looks like he realize his anxiety is not logical and gets frustrated about himself. He can sooth himself after a while when he has access to a calm area though.  


Lately, he decided he does not want to go to school anymore. We know things a re good at the school. What he says he does not like is the ""work"". He does not want to to anymore work, he says it's complicated and hard. But when he's not in that anxiety state, he does the work without problem and does not complain about.

Before I even got diagnosed with this, I had to put up with years of professionals getting stumped, giving up on me, not knowing how to help, contradicting each other, questioning whether my parents had abused me, and throwing different kinds of medications at me that didn‚Äôt work at all. This wasn‚Äôt always exactly cheap either. I just wish I could have it all figured out once and for all, but hesitate to keep consulting additional people. ADHD would be my first suspicion for comorbidities, but I have been told by multiple pros that I definitely don‚Äôt have it. I also considered depression, but was told by multiple people that I don‚Äôt have that, or any other mental illness either.

Executive dysfunction is by far the thing I am the most frustrated by and no one seems to be able to really help me with it at all. I also feel like it keeps getting worse somehow, but maybe I‚Äôm just noticing my impairment bumping up against the adulting that I didn‚Äôt have to do at some point earlier. I also feel like I kind of regress with it at times. According to part of my neuropsychological evaluation, I scored in the 0.1st percentile on some aspects of executive functioning.

I have a god awful time every single day initiating the most simple tasks and the mere thought most of them just feels daunting, draining, overwhelming, and anxiety provoking. I have bills in collection and am not allowed to schedule some appointments because of it. I frequently wear dirty clothes, including underwear with dried up blood, because I just can‚Äôt get going on laundry most of the time. Sometimes, just getting myself to stand up feels like a behemoth task where I have to manually tell myself to move each part, even when my mom is nagging me to come eat dinner, or get in the car. I procrastinate on pretty much everything and cramming for deadlines is the rule for me.

I am also horrendously disorganized. I lose and misplace so many things. I have gone through so many ID cards of various types and debit cards. I have never been able to properly use a planner, calendar, or alarm system as a way of organizing. I have a bizarrely contradictory relationship with routines and schedules, where I sometimes get disproportionately and visibly upset when something minor about something planned changes, but actually have a hard time setting my own schedule. I avoid routines, because I know I could get too attached, and also because I give up as soon as the slightest thing goes wrong with it.  My computer and phone are a mess and frequently run out of space, where I can‚Äôt even easily locate what I need to delete. My bedroom looks like it could belong to a hoarder. I‚Äôll even leave dog pee, expired food, and used menstrual products around. I can‚Äôt remember the last time I slept with sheets on my bed and it is frequently filled with crumbs and other things that don‚Äôt belong there. 

Additionally, I often have a terrible time switching tasks and shifting my attention, especially when I try to do it with no outside assistance. But when I am prompted to switch too spontaneously, or am suddenly bombarded with too many things to do by someone, I sometimes have random outbursts. It could be as simple as moving from my bed to getting my teeth brushed, and it could take an hour.

Sometimes, I just get so defeated and frustrated with this that I just give up for the day and lay in bed and stare off for long periods almost unable to move, or spend a long time pacing around engaged in the types of stims I would be embarrassed to show in front of other people to take the edge off of my emotions surrounding the situation. At least I finally got my parents to ease up to an extent on the nagging.",autism,1579544553,quargsg,9,1,True,2020-01-20
Could I be on the spectrum if I don‚Äôt struggle that much socially?,"Hey guys! I‚Äôm a female, 25 years old. 

Here are the things that I struggle with daily:

1.) Sensory overload: For a long time now, everything has been too loud and too bright. For a while I thought that this was due to HPPD as I‚Äôve experimented with MDMA and psychedelics in my early teenage years and I was heavy marijuana user for 3 years in my adult life. If I stare at something for a little, it will start to shake, and reality is typically static looking to me. That being said I‚Äôm not at all sensitive to tastes, smells or textures.

2.) Obsessions: I find certain topics extremely fascinating. When I like something, it‚Äôs all I want to focus on, learn and talk about. I find things that are unrelated to my interests boring. I will listen to people talk about them, but I will generally stay quiet unless the topic is related to me or one of my interests. Sometimes I catch myself talking about something when it is clear that the other person doesn‚Äôt care/isn‚Äôt interested in it. I also really love puzzles and find them very relaxing. 

3.) Stimming: In the office, I am constantly moving back and forth in my chair, shaking my legs or tapping my fingers. The only way that I can focus is by either doodling or moving some part of my body over and over again. I also make bubbles inside my mouth (I know gross) but I like the process and how they feel inside my mouth. 

4.) Seeing patterns.

5.) Thinking in pictures.

6.) Prefer being alone: I love being alone and I often feel guilty because of it. People just exhaust me, I know that I should like being around them, and sometimes I do, I usually prefer being by myself or around people that I‚Äôm very close to.

7.) Selective social skills: So this is the thing that makes me doubt things. I can be pretty great socially when I ‚Äúturn it on‚Äù. For example, I can be great at job interviews, and certain one on one interactions. I can appear very friendly and people generally seem to like me. However, I have trouble really connecting with people and I‚Äôm typically only good at surface level interactions. 

8.) Never tried to make friends: I always had friends. In elementary school, I even remember being close to many of them. In 5th grade I immigrated to the U.S. and I still made friends fairly easily, but the thing is, my friends always picked me. I never really had to go out of my way to make friends, in 7th grade I moved to a new school and I basically had no friends for 3 months until someone decided they wanted me as their friend. When I really think about it, I‚Äôve never really had to make the effort to make any friends and I never really knew how, but people always seemed to come into my life regardless. But things got kind of rough in college and I lost pretty much all of my friends, including my best friend of 8 years. I‚Äôve noticed that I can always manage to draw people in, but I have trouble getting close and maintaining friendships. Right now, I‚Äôm mostly closest to my family, my boyfriend, and I have like 2 friends that I see semi regularity. In social environments, I will always manage to befriend people, but again, the friendship are never maintained, and I often feel like the weird awkward one who is the least close to everyone else in the group.

9.) I am diagnosed with panic disorder, anxiety and depression. I have suspected that I have BPD in the past, due to the fact that I can split on people and I often have black and white thinking.

Sorry that this post is long, but let me know if you relate to any of these symptoms! Should I talk to my doctor about these symptoms? Or does this sound more like ADHD to you? Any comments would be helpful. Thank you all.",autism,1579547081,iheartplant,4,1,True,2020-01-20

Noisy new apartment,"Hi all! I need some help. I just moved into a new apartment and I‚Äôm really struggling with the noise. Most people would probably think it‚Äôs nothing; the neighbors upstairs walk a bit heavy on their feet, the walls are thin so I can hear the people next door when they drop things, slam cupboards etc. so far no one being super obnoxious. But for some reason I get so much anxiety. I feel like I can‚Äôt be at home in my space and I dread being there. I know it‚Äôs irrational and lots of people can hear their neighbors, but its making me exhausted in all other aspects of my life. I feel like I don‚Äôt have control of my environment or have my own private space to retreat to. I don‚Äôt want to resort to drowning it out with my own music/sounds all the time, because I don‚Äôt want to disturb them either.

Resources for NTs with close autistic friends/partners,"Hi! I have a very close friend who's autistic. Most of the time our relationship is pretty good, I love their straightforwardness and we are able to resolve most misunderstandings , but sometimes it gets really complicated, my feelings get super hurt, I get upset, they're upset but not asking what's going on because they're avoiding conflict, I will not escalate fearing I'll upset them(or because I'm so hurt and have no patience or energy) and be passive aggressive and sad, and so on.

I've only recently started looking for resources, and all I come across is ""be friendly treat them like a human being"" 101 stuff basically. We're well past that stage, we've known each other for years and I'm more interested in more complex situations, how I should deal with my feelings and expectations in this context. Things like how to discern between situations where I'm right to be annoyed for doing all the emotional work, and where I'm just not being patient enough. What to do with feeling the need to mourn they'll never ask how I'm doing out of spontaneous interest. And so on

I love my friend and our relationship means a lot to me, and I would like to find a way to explore and deal with these complicated feelings.

If you have any recommendations - books, texts, online communities, etc, let me know!

Can I be autistic if....,"Hey all I'm a 21 year old female who recently read a few articles on being an adult female with autism. Everything I read really resonated with me. For years I've suspected that I have borderline personality disorder because I have a very long history of completely cutting out friends that at one point were people i had an extreme attachment to. A lot of things about borderline personality disorder just didn't seem to fit me though. I brought it up with a therapist i was seeing for a few years as a teenager and she's very holistic and i don't think she really understood the magnitude of what i was trying to describe to her and she told me it was normal behavior and that when i reached age 25 my brain would be fully developed and I'd stop having these issues with social interaction. I struggle with connecting to people and I always feel that I have to meet them where they're at so to speak to fit in. Since childhood I've picked up social traits from TV shows and people in my life that I saw being rewarded and I would actively try and mimic everything I observed even down to the facial expressions. Clothing can be difficult for me and I have a long history of developing mystery rashes that doctors could not treat. I also have an extremely sensitive stomach and have had a lifelong problem with nauseous episodes that leave me bedridden. The episodes are triggered by anything from dairy/gluten, humidity changes, temperature changes, bright lights, strong smells etc. Anything overwhelming in my environment can trigger me into feeling very very sick. I also have always had intense special interests based around how things function. It started with horses and then evolved into anime and now I'm intensely interested in fashion and world religions and how they influence humans. I keep reading that these are common things amongst people who are on the autism spectrum. A few things are confusing me though. When I was a baby I can see in some photographs I'm not making eye contact even though I'm being prompted to by my parents, but I actually do manage to make eye contact in some of them. Also I wasn't necessarily uninterested in touch as a baby. My mom and I would cuddle quite often and I have a lot of vivid memories of crawling into bed with her because I did not like to sleep on my own for a large portion of my childhood. Also clothing tags only bother me sometimes, and I actually prefer to wear materials like corduroy, or velvet. So that makes me think I'm not autistic and I'm just.....I dont even know. Maybe I'm experiencing ADHD and I'm about to have a psychotic episode or something? I read that before having an episode you can become more sensitive to smells and lights and such? I don't know I guess I'm probably just thinking about it too much I just don't really fit into the autistic stereotype so to speak and it's making me think maybe I'm not autistic at all. I'm getting evaluated in about a month so don't comment just to tell me to get a diagnosis, because I'm already going to do that. I'm just wondering if my ability to make eye contact with my mother as a baby, and also my ability to show affection means theres no way I can be on the spectrum.",autism,1579570291,unoriginalthot,7,1,True,2020-01-20

Writing an Autistic Character,"I am currently in the process of writing a series of stories that I at first saw as a TV Show, but now i'm considering doing it as a book series. While theses stories contain several interesting and unique characters , one of theme sticks out to me more than the others.

His name is Daniel, he's about 19-20 years old, and is the boyfriend of the main characters best friend. But he doesn't really become relevant until about halfway throughout the series. Each character in the series has some sort of mental health issue, from anxiety and depression, all the way up to PTSD. But Daniel is a bit different. It is revealed that he has High-Functioning Autism.

Daniel is very much based on myself. When I was 18 months old, I was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome, ADHD, and Sensory Processing Disorder. This isn't related to autism, but I may also be a bit dyslexic. So a lot of the quirks he has are similar to the ones I have. So what I would like to do is list of some of his characteristics, and see what you guys and gals think of him, and whether or not what i'm doing with him is a good depiction of autism. I understand that Autism is different for everybody who has it, but once again, his autism is pretty much the same as mine. So without further a-do...

&amp;#x200B;

* He is not very social, and doesn't really like to talk that much. Also, he doesn't really get overly emotional about anything. However, he does open up to the main cast overtime, and becomes a lot less robotic. So while at first it may look like he doesn't care that much for the others, he actually care a lot about them, especially his girlfriend. but he is just uncomfortable expressing those emotions. So much so, that at one point toward the ending of the series, during a rather heated moment, he has an outburst and yells at the other characters. But he is so uncomfortable with himself after, that he actually cries a little.
* He has many talents. He isn't supposed to be a savant, but he is good at a lot of the things he tries. For example, he has perfect pitch, and is a reasonably good singer. But he doesn't really make a big deal about it, mostly using music as a stress relieving tool.
* He has a hard time focusing on things for long periods of time, and sometimes has to get up during class and just walk around a little. Or sometimes, he just will tap his foot, or ""stim"" with his hands just for something to do, and to make sure he doesn't feel like he is about to crawl out of his skin
* He is shown to sleep with his bed inside a tent. He frequently goes into his tent when is needs to decompress after a long day.
* Not sure if this relates to Autism or not, but he has a very quick wit. (something that I wish I had) He is also a writer, and a comedian. He hopes to possibly write for SNL one day
* He is one of those people who can't remember somebody's name five minutes after they tell him it, but he can tell you exactly how long the Titanic was, down to inches.
* He has moderate to severe anxiety, and sometimes is prone to panic attacks. But he has learned how to cope, and is working on pushing himself out of his comfort zone, and meeting new people and doing new things.
* He loves animals, especially dogs. He even has a dog himself that acts sort of like at therapy dog.
* His mind tend to wander when he talks for long periods of time, often going on tangents about stuff, before realizing he has veered of course.
* This one is more of a personal touch, but one of the ways he gets sensory input is from athletics. Having all that extra energy has led to him becoming a skilled Parkour/Free-running athlete.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry that this is really long, but I'm way to passionate about everything with this character, and the whole series in general. One of the biggest things that I want to do in the series is to have mental health be depicted as realistically as possible, and Daniel is no exception. So if possible, can you let me know what you think of him, and whether or not he is a good depiction of an autistic character.

"Driving my friend away, what do I do (Partly my actions are because I have ASD)","I (male, 21) only have 2 real friends (guy and girl), both met at uni. The girl (I'll call by her initial F here) I met 2018 at a low point in my life, and our friendship was awesome and really helped carry me through some tough times. It was not intentional at the beginning but halfway through last year I developed a crush on her.

It didn't work out, and she told me she didn't like me. I nominally moved on, but didn't actually. Maybe it was my Asperger's derived anxiety, or maybe it was real, but afterwards it seemed F was growing distant.

I started doing a lot of abnormally friendly things, like inviting her to lunch and paying for all of it, and frequently buying her gifts. There were 2 reasons, one because I panicked and was terrified to lose F as a friend, but secondly and worst of all, because I didn't really move on from my crush, and in my deluded state thought but doing good things for her I might turn things around.

(It's worth mentioning she already has boyfriend so in hindsight my actions were EXTRA STUPID).

My other friend (I'll call him R) warned me if I didn't actually move on from my crush, I won't be able to keep her as a friend. My mum even warned me of the same thing. I was stupid and didn't listen. I had a stupid plan made where if I keep being extra good to her not only will our friendship improve, but she might end up liking me.

Needless to say my little ""plan"" backfired hard. F stopped hanging with me. She felt awkward with me paying for stuff etc. She told me she didn't feel I treated her like a friend, but rather like someone I'm in love with (which was true). I explained to her my paranoid driving the aforementioned behaviour, but I had to lie that I truly have moved on and have no romantic intentions.

Now, I truly have no more romantic intentions. All I want to be able to do is keep her as my friend. But I don't even know if that is still possible. I'm in a state of panic because she hasn't replied to me asking whether we can continue to be friends, but she's seen the message.

I've recently been learning about the spectrum and I think I may be on it. Is it worth being officially diagnosed?,"I always felt I was different to most people. For years since I discovered I was gay, I believed that was the reason. But getting older and coming out and attempting relationships has still left me feeling abnormal and misunderstood.

I feel like I have 3 emotional states. My normal state, which is stoic and I think off putting. My hyper emotional state, where I'm too honest about my thoughts and feelings with no tact, and my performative state. Where I act and react like I'm auditioning for something in every conversation, to varying degrees of success.

And I can't stress enough that final one. I constantly feel like I'm acting. I'm always raising my eyebrows slightly, squinting when I smile, exaggerating facial movements. Bc it seems like everyone does it naturally. And I think I come off as fake to some people bc maybe I don't seem entirely genuine in my efforts.

I love to socialise and be included in things but I'm so a anxious bc others mostly assume I'm introverted or out of place. I often have to drink myself into a state where I'm just between the line of performance and honesty that people actually enjoy my company, but I don't feel that that's a healthy or long term coping mechanism. (I don't have a drinking habit this is just an observation I've made). 

It's like 4am and this may all sound like rambling. But would seeking a diagnosis, even if it's nothing at all, be useful to me? Did any one else discover this late in life and did it help at all to know?

I wised up to an ex,"Without dragging this out, I'll just say that we met in high school and not only fell in love but became amazing friends. 
However, after graduation, despite having the same group of friends, they all drifted apart; allowing me to see how two-faced they were but that girl and I had similar depression issues so there was always an understanding of how she acted.

She ghosted me months ago which she does when she hits rock-bottom so I shrugged and figured she was just focusing on getting to a better place. 

Jump ahead to a couple nights ago and she suddenly friend requests me. Cool; she's OK. However, a random dude does, too. (You cannot find me on social media without being given a direct link.) So I just looked and turns out she ghosted me to be with and get engaged to this dude. (Biggest issue she had was that I'm trans and she claimed to be lesbian.) She immediately apologized and blamed her poor mental health and ""she didn't want me to find out this way"". 

Right away, I start realizing that she was playing me like a fiddle all along; using my ""autism obliviousness"" to hide her motives. Before I can even think of a response, she gets pouty and says ""She's sad and was hoping I'd have a threesome with her and her fiance."" I told her no, that I was wise to her tricks and frankly insulted that almost a decade of friendship and support really meant nothing to her. (And that she, in a jealous fit of rage, made false claims of abuse of my other ex against me. Because I'm autistic, adult social services believed I was in an unsafe environment. They spoke to me for five minutes and threw the report out but still...only she knew our names.)

She immediately threatened to kill herself and I blocked her; she never will or was going to. She was using that to keep me in her life as a cushion. It hurts to know she's been using me but I've got amazing partners and friends. And I start employment classes tomorrow.

Just looking for more info about autism,"So I'm thinking there's a possibility I'm on the spectrum, but I'm not seeking a formal diagnosis because I don't think it would change anything for me. I'm just trying to understand myself.

I'm female, and I identify as a highly sensitive person (HSP) but without the empathy component. I have OCD, GAD, and sometimes get panic attacks. I had crippling social anxiety as a child and have only somewhat overcome it through repeated exposure and experience. When I go into a new social situation I like to have a ""safe person"" with me (like my husband) who can pick up my social slack and mitigate my anxiety just by being present.

I could go into a lot more detail (and will in comments if you ask) about my traits that cause me to suspect autism (like obsessive interests and certain physical sensitivities?), but what makes me doubt it is that I seem to understand social ""rules"" fairly well. (I could be fooling myself though.) Or maybe I just memorized the rules over time? (But how else would you do it?)

Dad in denial,"Hello everyone. Just want to share, maybe vent a bit and get some advice.

I have a 4 year old boy. He‚Äôs amazing. Funny. Smart. And he was diagnosed to be in the spectrum when he was about 2 years old.

I did not believe the diagnostic since the ‚Äúsigns‚Äù were pretty mild and he makes eye contact and all that.

We took him to speech therapy and occupational therapy. He was released from both after a few months. That validated my belief. I thought he had been misdiagnosed.

We now moved him to a new school and I did not mention anything related to his diagnostic of autism. 

2 weeks in the new school, the teacher called us and went round and round asking probing questions up until the point where we decided to tell her he was diagnosed... she asked to see the files, etc.

But now I am feeling awful. I think I was totally in denial. If a stranger can tell in 2 weeks he is not neurotypical then the diagnostic was probably correct. And now I am really starting to be concerned about his education, his development, his future...

He‚Äôs awesome in my eyes. And have friends. And make eye contact. 

But he has no interest in letters and numbers, is very picky to eat (specially textures), gets bit aggressive when he‚Äôs overexcited (hitting me in the face for example), and goes around and around to tell me stories. But I don‚Äôt see him as different from any other 3 to 4 year old boy...

What is so different in him that other people see that I don‚Äôt?! Maybe I am still in denial. If he really is in the spectrum I don‚Äôt want to be in denial. I want to help him. But how to be sure?!

Serious question: Why do neurotypicals over-share and over-explain things?,"Not saying we autists don't. I'm guilty of over-explaining things, usually when I'm nervous.  But here's why I pose this question...

I work at the front of an office. Every time (and I mean *every* time) a client asks to use our bathroom, they explain *why* they need to, even after we've told them they're more than welcome to use our facilities.  They ""really have to go,"" they drank a lot, they travelled a ways to get here, they have a medical issue, they're pregnant... there is always an explanation when none is needed.

Also, if someone calls and says they have to reschedule an appointment for whatever reason, they will go into *great* detail about their specific reason.  I had a woman call and say some of the lights on her car aren't working so it's not safe to be driving, hence the need to reschedule.

Instead of accepting my ""Ok, here's when we can see you..."" she went into a long story about who told her that her lights were out, where she was when she got this info, where she was going to get the lights fixed, and what she thinks the problem might be.

This isn't the first case of this happening. People over-share daily.  I'd say 80 percent of our clients do this.  I'd be lying if I said it didn't make me somewhat uncomfortable.  I can think of nothing to say but, ""Ok.""

I'm really curious if anyone knows the psychology behind this over-sharing or just why you, as an NT, have the desire to share seemingly excessive detail.

Some of my personal austistic quirks.,"Hey guys, I have actually started to take note of some of the things that I tend to do. I'm not sure if this is fully due to autism, or if it's just a personal quirk of mine. 

* I mostly tend to walk on my toes when I'm indoors. 
* Right before typing something on a keyboard, I raise the index finger of my right hand in front of the monitor. 
* I don't drink the last bit of liquid in a glass nor eat the last bit of food on my plate. 
* In general, starting anything and abandoning it halfway or slightly before I reach the end. This is not just with projects, but also with games, books, movies. It's a miracle if I ever finish anything.
* I wait 10 minutes after the shower before drying myself off with towels. 
* Stubbornness to follow somebody else's pre-made plan, and trying to come up with my own reasonings. 
* Greatly over- or underestimating the value of money, distances and time. According to me, the average building is 50 meters tall, the average street is 20 meters long, the average cost of a car is 4000 euros and the time spent on a car trip is 5 hours. 
* Trying to solve every problem that I face by creating a program for it, which usually takes longer than it takes to do it by hand.
* Completely starting over with something which has one tiny mistake rather than fixing the mistake. This might be the reason why it takes so long to write a program. 
* Struggling on basic concepts while having next to no issues with more advanced topics. 
* Zipping my coat when I am putting it on, even when I'm indoors.",autism,1579646396,account456123456,8,1,True,2020-01-21
The concept of side dishes is weird to me. Is it the autism?,"So, I was tweeting about things as one does, and it hits me mid-thread, that I'm tweeting about a thing it started to sound like one of those autistic features that you don't realize are rooted in your autistic neurotype until someone points it out to you, and then it's like yeah, ok: that makes it make sense. But enough context, on to the point.

The tweets more or less read 

""So, as the title suggests, the concept of side dishes is weird to me: my mindset is that an ideal dish should be a complete meal.  Like, yes the dish can have multiple components (as examples rice&amp;curry, cereal&amp;milk, and burger&amp;fries) , but those components should interlock with each other and not be interchangable. 

""Like, I thing you should be able to throw all the components in a bowl and have one unit or amount of a thing to eat. So, if it's a curry or a ramen, it's a bowl of curry or ramen (maybe with garnishes): If it's a sandwich and it comes with a side; that side should come on the sandwich. If it's two sandwiches, they should combine them into one really tall sandwich. Am I making sense.""

And, the thread that got me to think, wait is this an autistic tendency was the sterotype that autistics don't like their peas and mashed potatos to mix; cause I be like that: it doesn't cause a meltdown when it happens, but there's a lingering discomfort about it as it happens. But the tweets prompted a thought of *what about a pea-based sauce over the potatos*, *or a sauce with peas in it, would that be a problem.* And I came to the conclusion that for me, it wouldn't.

So does it seem to y'all that this preference for a unified dish could be rooted in my neurotype: that is to say (with loving affection for my neurotype), is it the autism?",autism,1579649572,Hydrahead_Hunter,9,1,True,2020-01-21

How to properly maintain close friendships/relationships?,"Not sure if this is a ""socially incompetent autistic"" problem or a ""just plain toxic person"" problem but I have a serious issue that I thought I had figured out until recently.

A couple of weeks ago I screwed up and ended up turning my closest friend on me. Basically some time ago she had made it clear that she didn't like it that if she was away for a long period of time unannounced that it was somehow my fault.  Anyway fast forward to a couple weeks ago and similar situation. She goes off the grid, I have a dream that she's gone, I get anxious, insecurities take over and in come the impulses. Long story short the thing she said not to say gets said, I'm a dumbass and don't take it back before she gets back, and when she does get back she goes ballistic. She takes offense, claims I had been lying to her for the last year and that she was never important to me. Apologies go unanswered and all that. She's basically done.

The other day I get a damning message from her saying how I had made her like my ""emotional punching bag"" and that I had tore her up inside, (Note: Aside from the instance mentioned above, she never confronted me about anything else being ""hurtful"" to her.) while also boasting about my ""replacement"" per se. It was written like she was getting rid of a lot of pent up frustration giving me the impression there was a lot of other things I was doing that she might not have let me in on. Maybe she was afraid I'd be mad? Sadly, after combing over it, I realized that I just couldn't disagree with what she said.

This caused me to evaluate myself for the next couple of hours; Thinking about my interactions with people, my sense of humor, (I can admit my sense of humor can cut if used the wrong way so that's #1 on my list to change.) etc... And to be honest, I don't like what comes up. Just thinking about a lot of the things I've said to people, even those that are my friends and even as a joke, are pretty mean. My closer friendships start to become one-way where I make it too much about myself, and I get insecure easily if I don't hear from them. (ie. I'm an attention whore.)

At this point, I'm convinced I'm a bully.

This isn't the first time either. When I was younger I used to go through good friends pretty easily because of behaviour like this. I spent a good while not getting close to anyone. Thought I would be better this time, and even though I've improved I was so wrong.

Right now I'm just trying to collect and reconcile with myself, while also reconciling with people I feel I was a little harsh to. Obviously she's a lost cause but there are others that have stuck by me that I have the opportunity to grow up and be a proper friends to.

How to deal with doctors not taking you seriously.,"I‚Äôve been going to therapy for the past 6 years and 4 of my therapists told me that suspected i‚Äôm autistic. I never got officially diagnosed until I was sent to inpatient for the last 8 weeks. I was ‚Äúobserved‚Äù and they said I don‚Äôt have autism but this goes against everything I‚Äôve been told by therapists. I have sensory processing issues, struggles with interpreting people‚Äôs emotions and sarcasm, I have intense interests and struggle with social situations. It‚Äôs hard for me to communicate my feelings/situations which is why (I suspect) they dismissed my suspected diagnosis. They didn‚Äôt give me any explanation for what I had or even give me any advice for how to deal with it. I had multiple sensory overloads because of nurses touching me and yelling me and 3 meltdowns in front of my therapist bc he got mad that I couldn‚Äôt express how I was feeling.

I started a thing,"Hi everyone, it's a sleepless night (something I ate is not agreeing with my stomach and giving me indigestion, ouch) and I decided to create a Facebook page called Actively Autistic in hopes of educating people on what it's like to actually be Autistic and to hear it from Autistic people.

I'll be posting all kinds of articles (from proper sources of course), images/memes (only a specific kind), resources, videos, and anything else I can think of.

I'm currently a psych major going for my bachelor's of science and I want to later get my master's in Autism so that I can be an activist or something. I decided that it's definitely not too early and so I made the page at 01:30.

If anyone is interested in being an admin on this page or just contributing in any way, please feel free to reach out to me and share my new Facebook page! Once again it's called Actively Autistic (I can't get a link for some reason).

Just wanted to share this,"I am a newly diagnosed 16 year old girl from Sweden. And atm I'm going through a pretty tough period.
Last year (2019) in August I started started high-school studying art. And well it went like shit. Probably because of my autism and I have gone to the same elementary school for 10 years so I don't think I knew how to make new friends because I've never needed to.
And the thing is I can't plan or imagine how things might go before hand so it came like a shock on my first day because I hadn't given it a single thought.
And from there it went down hill.

The high school I started was bad at giving information about where our classes where and what and where our study material was. So me having no friends to ask, went into depression and my parents started to call me in sick everyday. 

I've gone to a psychiatrist since I was around 11 because of what we thought was separation anxiety and anxiety turned out to be autism like 5 years later, on the 20th December 2019. Wihoooo. 

So now I'm on sick leave from high school, unable to study the thing I love, art. And I will have to drop out because I refuse to go back to high school because I'm traumatized from my experience. 

I'm very embarrassed of myself, I really don't want people to know, especially people from my old elementary school. I find it embarrassing. Because I'm scared they will think ""oh, that's why she acted like that"" blablabla. 
I feel like such a failure because everyone thought I'd turn out really successful because of my talent in art. 

And without any education I won't be able to get a job. And I can't imagine a job where I don't work with art. 
Idk what to do anymore. 

And by going on reddit I thought maybe there's other people that has gone through a situation like mine, and still manegd it through. 
Please tell me about it if that's the case.

Fixation/ sensory overload deescalation technique‚Äôs,"Hi everyone,
Hoping someone out there can help out if not at least identify with what‚Äôs been going on. 

Yesterday I found myself getting fixated/ sensory overloaded. I think what caused it was too many thoughts/ possibilities on what to do with the rest of my day. The longer I tried to think about it (I took breaks and tried to clear my head) the more I wanted to shut down. I tried taking deep breaths, and return to the start of my day to hopefully gauge the flow of things thinking that would help. 

I ended up becoming short and in a crabby mood for longer than I‚Äôd like to admit. Feeling a little out of control I (thankfully) was in the middle of cooking and found this to help (along with the operation I was cooking for returning home from work.)

My question is, do y‚Äôall find yourselves getting lost like this? Do you ever notice it before it‚Äôs too late? If so, what are some suggestions you can offer to keep things grounded before the mental windmill gets spinning to uncontrollable speeds? Or do you have to separate/ remove yourself from the situation and hope it solves itself with time like a migraine?

"Waiting for diagnosis for toddler, need advice please","Hello üëã 

I have just found this community. My daughter is 2 1/2, and we have come to realize she is most likely on the spectrum. Our pediatrician is fairly certain this is what is going on, but it is going to take a few months at least for the mandatory tests for hearing/speech therapy before we are able to get that screening to be sure and to get into the various programs that might be able to help. In the meantime, I am doing my best to research what this is and how I can help, without well, help. 

I have been struggling with her sleeping patterns since she was born. As a little baby, my only baby, I had no idea what was considered ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. I had nothing to compare it to. I just thought she was a fussy sleeper, and that‚Äôs just how she is. Her father used to wake up a lot in the middle of the night, I assumed it was a genetic quirk.  It‚Äôs been 2 1/2 years and I can count on both hands the number of times her and I have slept a full night. She normally is hard to go down, hours of effort, and she will stay asleep for mostly 4 hours but can go up to 6 and then she‚Äôs just up.  As you can imagine this is hard not just on me but it must be doubly worse for her...

Since I have been reading about this, I see sleep is a huge issue for children with autism. It makes so much sense now. I have already had blacked out windows and a routine for calming her down and getting her ready for bed, but I see other things they suggest to help. I have gotten her a low dose melatonin (3 mg) to give before bed, it‚Äôs been about a week now and it does not seem to help. I have ordered a weighted blanket for toddlers online and it comes hopefully day after tomorrow.. I am hoping for some relief from this. 
Tomorrow we are taking her to family naturopath to see if there isn‚Äôt something with her diet we can help with, maybe something in her diet is stimulating her? We do not do processed sugar in this house, she does like banana and her organic fig bars they naturally have sugar in them.

I‚Äôm not sure if there is anything else I can do, I‚Äôm just tired I think and am hoping someone here reads this and can offer me a suggestion I am not seeing. I just want my baby to sleep and be happy, her brain needs to grow properly.  I am realizing this is beyond me and I feel very helpless

Possibly Autistic,"I never would've thought that I might have autism until last year when my therapist talked to me about the possibility. I haven't gotten tested yet, but I'm kinda of hoping that I am? It would answer a lot of questions as to why I am the way I am...

I don't want to infiltrate in any spaces until I know, but I'm kinda desperate in trying to find coping mechanisms. Like if anyone else has any problems with oily skin or touching oily things as a sensory issue, how do you cope with it?

Last year, I had to leave because my back felt wet at school and I started crying and my grandma picked me up. No one knew what to do, and I still don't know what to do.

Also, I have a lot of trouble keeping.. or working with my friends. Someone I considered my best friend last year told me I talk too much about the things I like and she found it annoying. Now, I feel bad talking to anyone about the things I like. It freaks me out. Like how am I supposed to know??? 

Should I try to fight having such intense feelings over the things I like? Is it more of a con than a pro to be so deep into something? Am I losing sight of reality when I get into these things?

My closest friend right now is super sensitive and I really don't like it. She freaks me out when she starts crying, which she does a lot and I normally have no idea why??? She told me it's because she thinks I'll abandon her cause sometimes I don't want to hang out, or I don't always say 'I love you' or 'I miss you' back to her when she says it to me, but thats not because I don't care about her as a friend... sometimes it just makes me uncomfortable. 

She blocked me on everything one night when I told her that it makes me wanna hang out with her less when it feels forced... I don't like having people at my house either??? How am I suppose to have friends when I don't want to hang out with them, and sometimes it's weird to talk to them?

Am I suppose to become a recluse???

Hair cuts,"Proud of my son for being so patient getting his hair cut today. This is one of the things that he has the most trouble with. His hair is always done by the same person, and I LOVE her, but goodness she is such a perfectionist! We let him have a break and got his sister's hair cut while he got to jump around and play for a bit. However, we just couldn't get him to put his shoulders down to get the one part of the hair on his neck and ears. 

Then the overload/melt down happened. Which is my fault, I didn't listen to him when he said he was done. Thank goodness my mom was there and went after him, and let him have his space so he could cool down, so I could pay, which took the lady forever to ring up! When I get to my mom I see my son at the top of the escalator. He didn't want her to come up with him, he just wanted some space. So many nice people at the mall offering to help, which I'm happy she declined. She told everyone that he was fine, just needed a little space and time. I went up to get him, and apologized for not listening quick enough. Told him how proud I was of him for trying to finish the hair cut. Told him I was proud that he told us he was done, and didn't lash out, but walked away instead. Especially since he stayed where Mormor (mother's mother) could see him.

Help!! I have no idea how to parent much less the proper way for autistic teenager,"I don‚Äôt how much background to include so I‚Äôll skip to the most immediate thing and edit to answer important questions....

My son is 15yo and was diagnosed almost a year ago at Level 1 autistic. I‚Äôve always known but we homeschooled since second grade and I‚Äôve always had honest conversations with him and catered to his needs while always trying to hold him responsible for things. Tried to teach him him how to navigate the world regardless....That being said.... it was always a controlled environment and so there have not been many huge difficulties.

Within the last two years, though, his dad and I got divorced, his dad moved to another country, and he started going to a small non profit private school that deals with students who need extra consideration.  Also, a few years before that his very close grandfather died.

So.... my son, L, had learned or developed ways to deal with his ‚Äústuff‚Äù. When he‚Äôs out in the world he really tries to fit in and be social and happy and just get along with everyone. Which means he‚Äôs suppressing the things that make him comfortable and by the time he‚Äôs home... he shuts Down and does the things that keep him level and calm. 

So.... all that being said. Im the only person in the world that understands and sees this but..

When it‚Äôs just the two of us I dont understand some things and I get offended.  I question three things..... is he declining to interact with me and the world on my suggestion because it‚Äôs being a teenager, being autistic, or just not liking me? He‚Äôs had a history of rejecting all of my teaching and suggestions upfront and then coming around. And I know deep down I‚Äôm the only one that really gets him and has his back. So why is there this initiate need to reject anything I put out?

I post this because he is sick right now and it is often very very difficult for me to tell what level of sick he is. In his mind, he truly believes he may be dying, and so he acts like he is *that* sick because to him that is the truth. Doctors are often unable to tell as well.

Fighting For Diagnosis,"Hello all, 

&amp;#x200B;

I just found this subreddit so please excuse any trespasses. I really need some help and I'm hoping you all can help in some way. If this is not the right place for this, please help me by directing me to a place where I can find my answers possibly. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 35 year old transgender (ftm) male, almost 36. I'm currently seeking a diagnosis of Autism because I feel like that is what is going on with me. My therapist is convinced it's OCD and I've given her articles that I was able to find that addressed the overlap and common misdiagnosis of older people. People my age tend to get diagnosed with OCD because today most people are children when diagnosed with Autism. 

I was not allowed to see a therapist as a child, my mother became irate when my school put me into speech therapy and wanted to do further testing. When I was little and I stemmed, my mother would hold my hands down to my sides and angrily tell me to stop acting like my sister (she has Cerebral Paulsy). 

At first I thought I may have Williams Syndrome until I learned that Williams is due to a gene deletion and I'm fairly certain that I don't have that as I also do not have the common Elf like features that go along with Williams. I do however have an intense need to be loved and accepted by others though I've never felt like I was.

I've always been the weird kid. I have intense interests in things like Martial Arts, Vampires, Music (another reason I thought Williams because williams kids LOVE music). I've always been accused of being anti social but I am not. I love being social with the right people it's just really rare that I find people who get me. 

Honestly, I'm fine with whatever diagnosis I receive, I'm not trying to diagnose myself but I'm wanting an accurate diagnosis and I don't feel that I'm being listened to. I feel as though every therapist I talk to has a bias against autism people and expects that if I am I should be non-verbal and extremely obvious. To me it is obvious. 

I love my routine, and I hate for it to be disrupted, primarily because if it's disrupted I forget to do important things. Like the other day at my job I decided to try to deviate from my routine and I forgot to clean the espresso machine. My manager was concerned because this was totally out of character for me. 

I struggle with eye contact. I can do it, but it stresses me out. It also stresses me out to look away because I know people expect eye contact, so I'm in a catch 22 there. I don't get sarcasm unless it's over the top and I misuse sarcasm at times or people don't pick up that I'm trying to be sarcastic. 

So my question is: How can I get them to see? And is a diagnosis really that important this late in my life? All I know is that I can relate to the struggles of Autistic people and doing the things that help Autistic people, like using a weighted blanket to sooth myself, help me. 

Please, I'm struggling here. Can someone please give me some kind words and guidance? Thank you all in advance.",autism,1579761009,TiggerMan420,7,1,True,2020-01-23

Asd vs. ADHD,"    I‚Äôm feeling a little lost and need some help. My son (10yo/m) saw a new psychiatrist for depression and anxiety related to bullying at school. He was diagnosed asd from age three and has been on medication for anxiety for about three years. This was an appointment to review and possibly switch medication as he doesn‚Äôt feel it is working anymore. 
     The new psychiatrist feels my son has adhd as well due to the fact he often fidgets, doesn‚Äôt sit in his chair(he tends to perch) and he gets distracted. When I say distracted I mean he ‚Äúzones out‚Äù. This is usually when he is over stimulated such as when he is in school or at a busy place like the mall. If he is at home, where we keep visual, audio stimulation at a minimum he is fine. He is able to stay on task with most things as long as he isn‚Äôt overstimulated, especially when it comes to his special interests. He isn‚Äôt at all impulsive and very rigid following rules. He does interrupt others conversations but not because he is impatient, he just has trouble knowing when is the appropriate time to respond and when that person is finished talking.

"My therapist said I'm not autistic because of this, what do you think?","Hi

I recently came across the ASD symptoms and I related to most of them and thought to myself: ""This explains everything!"" Also I took RAADS-R and AQ and scored very high on both, even higher that the average autistic people (based on what the [website](https://www.aspietests.org) said.) So I sought the opinion of a specialist. My therapist is a very good one, but isn't known to have a lot of experience with autistic people, at least not that I know of. I told her everything I thought was related and even explained to her that I strongly think I experience mind-blindness.

At one point in our second session, she said: ""I believe ASD isn't very well-defined, and I prefer to work with my patients' strengths and weaknesses and not concentrate on labels."" But I thought to myself: ""But I want to know if I'm autistic or not and maybe by this she means she's not going to give me a diagnosis about ASD at all."" So on the third session I asked her if at some point she would tell if I'm on the spectrum or not, and she said I might have some issues going on, but am not on the spectrum and she gave me some reasons that I'm not sure if they are valid or she's not familiar enough with the matter. One of her reasons that I wanted your opinion about it:

I explained to my therapist that I feel totally blind about other people and feel no sympathy toward them at all, but that's my feelings, and I can *understand* their point of view and feelings through *thinking rationally* about their situation and thinking about what I would've felt if I was in their position.

For example, if I see someone with an injury bleeding in front of me, I don't feel anything about it at all. But over the years of my life (I'm in my 20s) I've learned that in these situations I should think about other person's point of view, so in this example I think to myself:  
\**""This person is bleeding. It must be very painful. I should help them because that's the right thing to do, and it's right because 1- I would've wanted this if I was the one bleeding 2- I believe human life is important and we should help saving it if we can.""*

My therapist said this process (the part marked by \*) doesn't happen with an autistic person and they can't do this even by learning and thinking rationally about it like I do. Is she right?  
I should clarify that the process I described is not me understanding other person's point of view; it's me visualizing what *I* would have felt in the situation they *seem* to be in.

You can help me a lot by answering this. Thank you in advance.

I'm sorry,

Sort of new to all of this &amp; a rant,"My youngest child who is 4 was very recently diagnosed with autism. He's always had some quirks and different behavior &amp; sensory issues. It all came to a head though when he refused to leave his bedroom for a month. He's always been labeled as a ""difficult child"" and is prone to melt downs and can be very mean and moody. I have known something was different  about him always however by family and friends I was always told to quit comparing him to his brother all kids are different. Obviously I know that but I knew in my heart something was going on. The diagnosis isn't much of a shock and we are all doing fine. My son is the same person he always was only now we can help him the way he needs. Now my rant. I feel like nobody in our lives understands! I have family members telling me I am just trying to label and brain wash him and that I just am just looking for a reason to medicate him. My mother don't want to babysit him anymore now that there's something wrong with him, her words not mine. People are avoiding us and the people who are not keep telling me they are so sorry for us like my son has died. Friends don't understand that no we can't just get get a babysitter and go out drinking late at night cause it takes away from the bedtime routine and he won't sleep then and will be upset and have a melt down. He isn't just a bad kid who don't listen. Unless my husband stays with him I can't leave and vice versa. There are very few places he's willing to go and everything seems like a struggle.

1 year old stimming by scratching - how do I replace that,"So first of all, I don't think my daughter has autism. She makes eye contact, enjoys peekaboo, signals to be picked up, and points to things she wants. It's just I couldn't find any resource that would tell me what to do, and thought the users of this subreddit might have most experience with dealing with stimming.

When she is tired or angry, she will scratch her ears and neck. Not enough for the blood to flow, but enough to leave scabs shaped like tiny fingernails. She's been doing that since she was very little - definitely 3 months old.

Of course the first method is to avoid the situation that will cause stimming, which we have been doing quite succesfully till now. But she's entering the age when they throw temper tantrums. And if she's angry because I won't let her play with a knife or a hot kettle, it's not always easy to calm her down without giving her what she wants - which of course I can't do. 

So after the last tantrum, which involved 30 mins of crying and scratching, I started Googling. I found I can try and replace the harmful stimming with another form of stimming which will meet the same need without being hamful. But there were no examples of what I can do, or there were only examples  that older kids and adults can do themselves.

I need a method that I can do for her and gradually teach her to do on her own. Any ideas or own experiences?",autism,1579862919,gruniorowa,7,1,True,2020-01-24

My dating dilemma," M36 here. I‚Äôm an introverted creative person with high-functioning autism. My special interest is music, drawing, writing and all things creative. I‚Äôm generally not too interested in people but I need to be around them to function. People make me exhausted after a while.

Dating is the worst kind of social scenario for me and it makes me super anxious and stiff. And exhausted. 

Dating involves all the areas which I have difficulty with; showing empty, active listening, showing interest in the other person.

Small talk and cold talk makes it difficult for me. Even when I find someone with similar interests as me I get highly anxious around new people and it takes forever for me to relieve my anxiety.

I'm 36 and have been single my entire life. I have had a few possible occurrences where I have met a girl more than one time. But after I while it gets exhausting. All the socializing makes it hard.

It's already hard for me to socialize with non-female people which makes it even harder with dating. What is so easy for ""normal"" people is so hard for me, maintaining eye contact, responding appropriately to the other person, showing interest.  After a while, i just become disinterested in the other person.

Most of the time I like to be involved in my hobby and other projects. I love sating at home. I can‚Äôt imagine ever finding women that I can develop something serious with.

My mind is just filled with my own visual things and music. 

That's why I express myself better through writing, music and art.  I guess people are not for me. even if i need them but feel a wall between me and them.

ASD father with nonverbal ASD daughter (4) and 2 yo son that is likely ASD as well,"I knew my wife for a while and shes opposite of me on a lot of things, but before we got married I made sure she knew the odds of us having ASD kids was high. She was OK with that and homeschooling for ASD kids.

Well, its 5 years later and we now have 2 kids, 4 and 2. The 4 year old is a poster child for non verbal autism at the moment. She has said a lot of words a few times but has not continued to say them. For example, her first word was ""fish"" (actually ""ISH!"") at about 6-7 months. She said it a bit for a while, and probably hasn't said it in 3 years at this point. Same with ""dad,"" she called me dad twice, both in the same 5 minute span 12 months ago, and hasn't since. 

She is our rock star and she is a great climber with insane upper body athleticism. She can climb over anything and she is also very tall for her age .

My son we assumed was not autistic because he made eye contact right off the bat at 3 months. He also is a lot more interactive. But, we noticed in the past 6 months that he is showing signs of verbal regression as well. In addition, he is less interested in other kids than he was 1 year ago. When someone visited the other day, he ignored the visitor and instead was obsessed with an object they had with them.

He's also extremely into fans and spinning objects in general. Lately, we noticed he doesn't make eye contact either.

I am surprised because compared to our daughter, he is a lot more ""people oriented,"" but when we compare him to other kids, the difference is apparent. He is barely 2 and who knows, but he also stopped saying ""daddy"" and many other words.

I am glad my wife and their mother is open to home schooling because my experience in school was awful. They made me feel ""smart, but lazy"" and I internalized that for a long time.

However I don't want to be rude or hurt anybody so I feel obliged to be ""socially normal"" ""saying yes"" I try to be somebody else try to adapt since I don't want to draw any bad attention, or being rude. I don't want to hurt anybody, it's not like I don't like people it's just like I love to be alone with myself and being stressed out too much by social contacts. Don't know what to do I have to act now but I cant. I can't get help it's too close, so much private intimate questions. I wish I could live in my books in my bubble in my safety zone or best scenario ever doing everything online without human interaction. I know how strange that sounds, but I'm seriously desperate.

Can anyone with autism relate?,For a long time I‚Äôve felt that there‚Äôs like actually something wrong with me. When I started to become more introspective because of anxiety I thought maybe I was a psychopath or sociopath because of the abnormal way I feel. Looking back into my past I‚Äôm aware that I was an extremely troubled kid. I got expelled from my preschool. Sometimes I would get upset and completely shut down. The teacher would try so hard to get me to talk or acknowledge her presence but I didn‚Äôt have the will to get past my stubbornness.  I remember having to go to the school counselor too and I would shut down there too because I thought it was embarrassing that she would pull me out of class. I remember I would annoy people like my cousin‚Äôs friends that I just met with certain topic. Especially in middle school I was obsessed with ethnicity and race because I grew up with a mixed/unclear identity and sometimes people would tell me that I talk about that topic too much. I also repeat songs over and over or listen to the same song all day sometimes. I also have OCD but that might coexist with potential ASD. Also I would sometimes walk on my tip toes as a kid until my uncle and my cousins called me out on it. I always wiggle my leg or my toes or I bite my fingers sometimes or I tap to songs like a crackhead. When I was a little younger I was flapping my hands around like crazy because I was trying to be funny for my sisters friend but my sister told me to stop because it was likely giving her friend anxiety. Hahaha well anyways I‚Äôm just wondering if any of you guys who have autism can relate and or give me advice. I‚Äôd say that I‚Äôm an extroverted and kind of clingy person and I‚Äôve grown accustomed to making eye contact and stuff. I would even go as far to say that I‚Äôm kind of a dominant person in a social context. I still feel odd though.,autism,1579881583,Nuv3citos57,4,1,True,2020-01-24

Confessions Of An #AdultAutistic Anxiety Junkie,"Finding strengths in my autistic ""deficits,"" Anxiety &amp; Memory. From AutisticAF[AutisticAF.me](http://AutisticAf.me/).

""Wow,"" said Doctor Mike.

""Do you realize how many neurotransmitters you just burned up?""

Let me rewind the video just a coupla minutes to catch you up to speed‚Ä¶.

I see a psychologist for autism-related difficulties. I had just asked him about a confusing conversation I'd had with a friend, trying to figure out where I'd gone wrong, looking for tips on how to do better next time.

""Well,"" he said, ""you know the drill. Give me some idea what happened. But more important, try to tell me what you felt.""

I saw the Gates of Hell yawn before me‚Ä¶.

I tried to give him the shortest, simplest, least detailed explanation I could.

But as I began the wheres and whens, the scene flashed in my mind's eye‚Ä¶ the dark wooden room, what I was wearing, the traffic noise outside, the smell of cooking from the kitchen, the incomprehensible mini-grimaces on my friend's face, the slow, storm surge of competing emotions I felt...

Eagerness, disappointment, confusion, anxiety, anger, rage‚Ä¶ tongue-tied, I'm-gonna-die PANIC.
I guess I talked louder, angrier, faster -- finally stammering, stuttering....

""Are you okay??!"" He stopped me. Seemed like almost right away. He looked‚Ä¶ worried?

""Why?"" I asked, instantly switching to my usual conversational voice.

I gather I had gone from the therapist-approved,‚Ñ¢ hushed tones of an ""intellectually curious"" client to raging, ranting, lunatic -- loud enough to be heard from his waiting room -- in just moments.

He sat forward in his chair.

""What was going on for you just now?""

I knew I had ""done something wrong."" Been in therapy nearly 30 years. Gets so you just know.

Me, pretty meekly, ""I was remembering what happened and trying to tell you."" I felt guilty‚Ä¶ and suddenly so tired my eyes ached from trying to stay open....

""And now that you're done remembering‚Ä¶ you're calm again."" He looked off a moment.

""Are you telling me you were actually reliving the memory‚Ä¶ so you could remember?""

""Um. Yeah,"" I said. ""How do you remember?""

Apparently, not THAT way‚Ä¶.

Dr. Mike gave me a quick info-dump on dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine‚Ä¶
How neurotransmitters are precious, complex biochemical hormones that take our bodies tremendous effort and energy to create‚Ä¶

And to use.

And how I had just used up so much of them, my mind and body were falling into collapse. A mini-autistic burnout.

""How often does that happen for you?""

""You mean, like, how many times a day‚Ä¶?""

So‚Ä¶ we went on to talk self-care.

But something ELSE was happening besides social anxiety...

I realized why, so often, when I try to say something new, I get loud or passionate or angry‚Ä¶

I'm getting a fix of my favorite drug‚Ä¶

And it has side effects.

See, I'm not chasing the memory or awkward communication butterflies today.

I'm chasing the elephant in the room.

Anxiety.

So, please allow me to begin again‚Ä¶

Hello, I'm John. And I'm an anxiety junkie. And this is my story...

Anxiety isn't just something I suffer.

I've come to realize it's a drug I use. And abuse.
Sorta like caffeine. If caffeine were meth.

Like some autists, I have difficulty waking up. As in, I may not really understand what's going on the first coupla hours after I get up.

I may be confused about where I am.

I may not have enough energy to do‚Ä¶ anything. 

I may find speaking very difficult, even in short sentences. Why use two syllables when one will do‚Ä¶

There are even names for this. Sleep drunkeness or confusional disorder.

So I drink coffee. Caffeine helps. Some....

But like any substance I use to alter my mood, it has a down side. Too much triggers edginess.

And, unfortunately, it's addictive. So I use more and more to chase the same high‚Ä¶

Right up to the point that I use too much.

I've come to believe I have always used the self-generated neurochemicals of anxiety in the same way.

I first noticed it with procrastination.

Since junior high, I waited later and later to write term papers. In my early teens, hitting the encyclopedias less than a week before the due date.

By college, I was smashing a semester's research &amp; writing into 24 to 36 hours of sustained effort. At first, just every single waking hour over two days. By senior year, starting midnight Friday and finishing dawn, Sunday.

No meals. Only necessary pee breaks.

Grad school? Starting the day after it was due‚Ä¶ handing a paper in a week late and taking the grade cut.

Eventually, just flunking out‚Ä¶.

Not because I was lazy, stupid, disorganized, whatev.

Because I needed ever greater doses of FEAR coursing through my veins to have enough ENERGY to slog through details, make decisions, choose words, create topic sentences, order a logical flow‚Ä¶.

Without fear‚Ä¶ I could not think.

Late in life, I began to suspect that without anxiety, I can't relate. Even with loved ones.

A single case makes the point. I love being alone. And, G-d knows, I love being with my wife.

But, if I spend a long time alone, say when she visits family for a day or two, it's as if my emotional and expressive centers power down.
She returns home to a husband uncommonly quiet, unexpressive, uncommunicative, curt...

Until the anxiety of the awkwardness warms up my inner radio tubes‚Ä¶ and suddenly I feel ""friendliness"" seeping into my brain and I'm back to ""normal.""

In fact, at some point, I realized I need anxiety to have the strength to communicate much‚Ä¶ at all.

People who first meet me have the impression I talk a lot. And I do‚Ä¶

But a LARGE part of what I say is short memorized phrases, sayings, repeated jokes, pop references, quotes, canned bits of trivia, Jim Carrey-like cartoon voices.

This can be an autistic behavior. It would be more noticeable if I repeated, say, a few dozen phrases...

Rather than the hundreds, even thousands, I use.

But anyone who actually begins to know me, eventually notices‚Ä¶ like the thousand or so background music hits you hear in Walmart... My repetition can eventually tire you out.

The point is, to actually create more than one or two original sentences at a time is usually more than I can accomplish in conversation.

Unless I'm pumped up‚Ä¶ on anxiety, or its twin devil spawn, fear and anger.

It is true that sometimes, too rarely in the past, the experience of explosive autistic joy can get me where I need to go.

Also true, in the last few years since diagnosis, joy is coming more and more frequently...

But bottom line?

I have trouble doing the things I live for‚Ä¶
Loving and creating‚Ä¶

Without twisting the dragon's tail of anxiety... permitting it, even encouraging it.

Anxiety was once something ""bad"" to me. To be avoided like the plague.

But I've come to a value-neutral view of anxiety.

Like most of my autistic traits, it can be a strength or a weakness‚Ä¶ in the right place or time.

So, like any junkie...

Any easy job?,"Pretty long as it its really complicated 
I somehow managed as a career but people accused me just to get rid of me since I'm to slow and like to actually interact with people insted of doing work chop chop (seriously, i had a resident freak out on me that i want something from her because i was so nice to her)
And in general, i like hugging people, as it keeps me going otherwise i go back in depression, but again people don't like seeing this and pick on me and something on the people I hug but I'm more vulnerable as I'm just lisen and sallow every they tell me unless someone else points out that they are bullying me because x and z doesn't make sens and i only had best of interest.
I'm heavily dislexic and social fobic.
As such, i need routine
Something like:
Cashiers - due to dyslexia, i have high chances of giving wrong change or similar
Warehouse - i wanted to die before going back to be surrounded by those unfriendly and some disgusting creatures.
And even so, i can't keep up with speed. So anything like shop assistant, due to my social anxiety, its even worse. I'm basically little child level despite being 27....
I'm currently being given benefits that are not enough for anything so need to access my saving as well. I was told i need to try and at least part time. But i have no clue what. Last time I tryed working in a charity shop for experience, i feel like throwing up and dizzy all the time. And even once i got home, after 4 hours, most time spend sitting and chatting with friendly coworkers, the job was easy, i still ended up needed to rest for 3 hours before o could move
I don't want caring and I can't cop anymore with others (thing got worse after warehouse and caring job, not that they were brilliant before)
So i have no clue what to work, even partime.
Since due to my dyslexia, someone always needs to keep and eye on me (I'm at that level that if i do something but see my battery on a device its low, unless i put it on charge straight away i forget) and i can't cop anymore with people who don't understand and don't care, saying that i only make excuses.",autism,1579888985,Green_Cat_C,1,1,True,2020-01-24

Advice to deal with my younger brother with Autism?,"I have a 10-year-old brother who has autism. From what I have heard, he is at the low end of the spectrum and the professionals my family has met with, says it is possible for him to revert back to a fully functional person. From afar he looks like any other kid but when u watch him closely, you can see his mannerism isn't the same. He is socially awkward and struggles to make friends that he can hold a connection with. He loves drawing and cutting out the characters so he can physically just hold them. He loves movies and he often recites the lines from movies as responses even though they don't connect with questions. He also feels threatened by me in some sense because he acts out the most when I'm around. Regardless he would still be devastated if I left him. Sometimes I have lost my temper when he had destroyed my stuff or purposely irritates me. I'm learning to become more patient with him.

I have a load of medical issues so at lot of times it's hard for me even to go out of the house and trying to relate to people is about near impossible as I spent most of my childhood by myself due to severe depression and such so I don't have nearly much of any experience with things (in addition to chronic health issues which leave me tired almost always).  I would really just like the opportunity to meet some friends over the internet and maybe get to enjoy some interactions which I've been desperately wanting for quite some time.  Some of my interests are gaming, music, sports, business, languages, animals and just about everything really.  If you would like to chat let me know and if you happen to know of any establishments interested in someone who needs someone who is familiar with business dealings  (remotely/over the phone) if you could let me know I would literally repay you tenfold as I really want more/other work as the current work I am doing is tiring (better than 9-5 work physically, but it's a bit mentally demanding) so other remote phone work would help me out so much.

I've seen a few GPs lately regarding my concerns over some of my symptoms and I was referred to a psychiatrist/mental health team in Wales.  
Following this, I went back to my GP to catch up and ask some more questions and found out that instead of seeing a general psychiatrist for a general checkup(?), I've been directly connected with an autism specialist to be checked for autism.  
I have since received 3 questionnaire forms and have filled them all out and mailed them back and am now waiting.  
I'm not sure what there is for me to do now and I'm a very impatient guy, I sent the mail less than a week ago and I'm already bored and want the results back lol. Based off how fast I received the forms my GP thinks I should be checked in rather soon but I still want something asap.

My autism is becoming my super power,"A goal of mine is to learn German. I know it's not going to be easy and it is frustrating at times.

But I'm an aspie.  And I realized that when I get interested in something, and determined enough to see it through, I learn everything I can through all sorts of resources.

Last summer, I knew nothing about setting up a proper fish tank. Now, I've successfully run a nitrification cycle and my tank is ready for live fish!

When I told my fiance I wanted to get back to learning German, he said that sounds great!  When I said I doubt I can, he told me to ""treat it like a special interest.""  And so I did.

At work, I reassigned my whiteboard to house a new verb each week.  Two days have gone by and I've mastered the verb 'to have.'  Present, past, and present perfect (and I'm working on the other tenses.)

I've one book at work for visual learning, one at home with vocabulary lessons, I use DuoLingo once each evening, and I write verb conjugations on certain subjects during my down time at work.

Three days ago I was angry with myself because I didn't think I could understand one verb's conjugations.

*I've learned seven.*

"I hate autism today, sorry, not sorry.","So, I have an autistic son and I know I‚Äôm not supposed to hate autism. I‚Äôve bought into, and thought I believed all the hype. I‚Äòm not supposed to hate autism, but hate the anxiety that comes with it. Hate the inability to be spontaneous. Hate the world around who doesn‚Äôt accept or accommodate autistic needs. But today, I hate autism. 

I also have a non-diagnosed Aspie sister. With girls being underdiagnosed already, and less autism awareness when she was small, she never got a diagnosis, even though my mom was always asking teachers and doctors if the things she did were normal. She masks heavily, so none of these teachers or doctors ever saw the meltdowns. (This was LONG before camera phones.) My mom first heard about Aspergers when my sister was 17, and we all have absolutely no doubt she‚Äôs Aspie. 

She‚Äôs always had trouble making friends. She was constantly a target for people who used her. She‚Äôs naive and good-hearted. She believes what people tell her at face value. She gets taken advantage of a lot. She moved far away for grad school. It‚Äôs her first time out of the state and she‚Äôs been aching to be home. She‚Äôs not found a core group of close friends. She‚Äôs in a state with dramatically different weather, and no vehicle, which is harder to navigate. Plus the regular stress of school and work. 

Last night, after a class that was talking about depression, sense of belonging, and sense of community, she tried to kill herself. It was a feeble attempt (a few pills) and she felt immediately guilty and threw up, then called an old friend because she was too embarrassed to call her family. Thankfully her friend texted my mom, and we got her some help.

"I (18M) am seeing a movie with the first actual friend (21F) I‚Äôve made in a while, next weekend, but am kinda confused about my feelings for her. (TLDR at bottom)","So next weekend I‚Äôm seeing a horror movie with a girl I meet last semester, in one of my history classes. I‚Äôm a male turning 18 tomorrow, and shes 21. I know there is an age difference and what not, and that seems to upset people, but try to ignore it, she‚Äôs never dated before, and while she is more emotionally mature than me, I think that has more to do with me having Aspergers. Anyway that part is fine, Canadas age of consent is 16. 

Not that, that really matters, because my intention was to kinda go as friends. Essentially I did not have friends during high school, and for a long time, for a bunch of reasons including my parents having a rough divorce forcing me to move around the world a bunch, plus me just being super socially awkward, and having Aspergers. But I go into university and kinda change my act. The only person I really saw anything long term with was this girl though.

Long story short, I meet her and I clumsily become her friend, doing a bunch of awkward things along the way. I kinda made her think I was trying to date her at one point, (which at the time I was not), but we talked it over, she explained that she is ‚Äúnot interested in dating at the moment. But happy to be friends‚Äù, and I assured her that was my intent. I also explained to her that I had Aspergers, and she assured me that it was okay, and that she is socially awkward and shy herself.

So we share a bunch of interests, were both pretty nerdy and shy. Shes super into the Lord of the Rings, and all Tolkiens lore and stuff. Were both really into History too, as were both history students. It‚Äôs not so much that I am into everything she is into, I just kinda can relate to her level of interest, if that makes sense. She has just a few close friends, rather than a lot of not so close ones, which is what I‚Äôm kinda aiming for myself. Anyway, so we kept up via social media over the Christmas break, meet up once we got back, and now I‚Äôve invited her to see a movie at the local theatre, which she has accepted... 

Now the reason I tell you my life story above this, is that I think I‚Äôve kinda fallen for her, and I‚Äôm a bit confused. This is kinda what I mean by emotionally immature. I dunno if she feels the same way, but I kinda doubt it, as she did tell me she was only interested in being friends, but that was quite a while ago, before we got to know each other better. I don‚Äôt really wanna confess, and risk ruining this friendship, like I do honestly like her as a friend as well, and right now shes my only real friend tbh. I am trying to make other friends as well, but to not much success so far. And I also don‚Äôt want to ‚Äòmake any moves‚Äô, not if I don‚Äôt know how she feels about me. But I guess if I, or her, wanted to, a horror movie would be a great place to do so. So yeah, I‚Äôm looking for advice for what to do in general. 

TLDR: Didn‚Äôt have friends in high school, but changed my act in university, and befriended this girl. Were both shy and nerdy history students. We ran into a miscommunication in the first month we meet, and made her think I was trying to date her accidentally. I was not trying to at this stage, and told her so, and she told me she was she was ‚Äúnot interested in dating at the moment. But happy to be friends‚Äù. I was happy at the time when that was all I was looking for. Fast forward to next year, we‚Äôve meet up after the holidays, I‚Äôve invited her to see a horror movie next weekend, but I‚Äôve kinda fallen for her... I‚Äôm not sure what to do, if I should get over it, or try something. It‚Äôs been a little while since she told me she was not interesting in dating, and we‚Äôve gotten to know each other much better in the meantime.",autism,1579976832,GeneralWalters421,19,1,True,2020-01-25
Peace of mind,"My little guy is remarkable and I wouldn't change a thing about him. We all have areas where we have to work harder to learn something. My fella is mostly non-verbal. He works really hard to improve his verbal skills but the lack of conversational speech, can make frustration and anger, really hard for him to reconcile. 
As a result, he occasionally breaks things. 4 ipads, 6 kindle/notepads, 11 cell phones, 4 televisions, 5 remote controls, 4 bedroom windows, 2 picture windows, 2 car windows, 2 laptops, 1 xbox One, 3 xbox controllers, countless outlet covers and more. Over the years, he's improved significantly but I still feel stress and fear, pretty much constantly. 
The items broken weren't always mine. The money spent has drained our savings repeatedly. We rent our home and I'm terrified he will cause damage that I can't afford to fix. 

Until last Thursday. 

I was paying my car insurance. I was asking for a few extra days to pay because all at once, our car broke down and our little guy busted another $250 window. 

They must have recognized something in my voice because she stopped my rambling said, ""why don't you have renters insurance""?

I said,
""I can't afford another bill if I cant afford a window"".

She said, ""Renters and homeowners insurance would have covered every bit of everything you described. The electronics, the walls, the lights and outlet covers and especially the windows. Whether it's yours or a friends, on accident or on purpose because he's frustrated- it's all covered.""

Is autism without meltdowns possible?,"Tl;Dr: Are these meltdowns? Could I have autism without meltdowns?  
I'm currently going through the process of trying to diagnose my (potential) mental illness/condition and the most recent news is that I have been referred to an Autism specialist, much to my surprise.  
Since then, I have had questionnaires to fill in and send back.  
I have never considered myself to potentially have autism, however I feel like I do express a lot of the symptoms, but primarily I don't seem to express meltdowns. If I do, they don't seem to be in the most obvious way.  
I am a sensitive guy and have a tendancy to cry easily, but I would never consider it a meltdown. If it could be described as such, I wouldn't imagine it be a very intense one, however last time this happened I realised I essentially stopped being able to hear the person who was telling me the upsetting news and I just wanted to leave.  
I haven't really been keeping track of these potential ""meltdowns"" because I never considered them severe enough however I will look into doing so. Until now I just considered myself to be emotional and get tired out after long days lol.

Autism Awareness,"My friend was speaking of a guy in her class being weird and having random outbursts and everyone just knows he‚Äôs ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù.

 the same roots of and sounds very similar to the word lonesome or alone which might explain why this misinformation exists.)

I found a diagnostic centre but I need a parent present to answer developmental questions. I want to ask my dad but I'm scared.,"I've been really anxious and unable to do things today, but thanks to this awesome sub I was able to find a clinic at the university of Munich which offers adult diagnosis for ASD. This is a huge step because it has been really hard finding info online for adults on the spectrum. I'm 24 and I want to get an evaluation... I just want to know. 

My brother is 6 years older than me and underwent a lot of testing when he was a kid and turned out to be a highly gifted child with extremely high IQ. All of my parents energy went into raising him (a lot of fighting and screaming) and I flew under the radar. I was odd, I had tremendous trouble with social integration and with communication, I was bullied and self harmed. 

This past new years my parents visited and I tried to open up about this stuff because I am getting exhausted from carrying all my emotional baggage. It went very badly, my mother has always been quite depressive and fragile, they have a certain narrative that they made for me about my life and strongly rejected the idea that I was not fine, or that I was bullied. My mother said a lot of very hurtful things, that I am depressed because I hang out with people from broken families and convinced myself that I'm like them, and other frankly narcissistic things to protect herself from my reality. I asked her why I never underwent those tests that my brother took, as my teachers suggested that I might also be gifted, and my mother said ""I already knew you had it too, so why would I need to have you tested?"" 

I currently live in spain but I am german and dont speak spanish, so I want to get myself a hotel in Munich for a few days and go to this clinic and talk to professionals about it. I dont want to tell my mom because I am at a fragile point in terms of who I think I am and I already know she will reject it and ridicule me. But my dad is more gentle and  supportive. 

They require a parent to accompany you to the appointments at the clinic to answer medical and developmental history questions. I want to ask him to go with me, but I also don't. I'm afraid that he will tell my mom and I will deal with repercussions forever. I'm also afraid of the diagnosis, that things may get worse or that the process could be traumatic or upsetting, or that if I come out as not being on the spectrum at all I will be even more alone with myself than I am now.",autism,1580043362,Procrasturbator2000,7,1,True,2020-01-26
"Not looking for a diagnosis, just over hear realizing at 36 that I‚Äôm probably autistic","I‚Äôm a 36 year old woman‚Äîthey didn‚Äôt diagnose smart little girls with autistic when I was a kid.  Here are some of the excuses I‚Äôve used in the past for why I am obviously not autistic:   

*I hate math.
*I love art, English and writing; although, as an adult, I prefer nonfiction, I loved fiction as a child.
*I was a very early talker, and my parents say I went from no speech to speaking like an adult.
*I‚Äôm not literal at all.  
*I read people‚Äôs emotions well, but it‚Äôs taken me a long time to figure out what the hell to do with other people‚Äôs emotions.
*I have diagnosed OCD, which explains all the symptoms of autism I have.
*I mask very well.  I am a school counselor.

Yet, here I am:

*My son is autistic.
*I have always been hyper sensitive to sensory experiences.  I hate bright light.  I have all my electronics turned to the dimmest setting, and it still feels too bright.  I wear sunglasses outside even if it is super cloudy or evening, and I have no clue how people go around not doing that?
*I constantly notice things no one else notices.
*I have ‚Äúpanic episodes‚Äù that are better explained by being meltdowns.  Things I have done during a ‚Äúpanic episode‚Äù:  slam my hand in a door or drawer as a kid (did this all the time as a kid to control my emotions, thought nothing of it?!), pull out a chunk of my own hair, scratch the side of my face of my arms, drawing blood, curl into a ball and cry hysterically (most common).
*Stimming:  I need constant sensory input.  I am currently chewing on the edge of a blanket as I type.  I chewed up all my shirts as a kid.  I am always leg bouncing.  In meetings, I find a paper clip that I can destroy under the table.
*I had a lot of difficulty when I was younger controlling my emotions.
*I was extremely socially awkward as a kid, but I studied people and learned to mimic them.  I pre-practice most social interactions to seem more normal.  Counseling school was interesting for me because I got direct feedback on how to mask.
*I‚Äôve always hated being directly told what to do‚Äîit makes me viscerally angry for some reason.
*I‚Äôm a great standardized test taker.
*I have odd, obsessive hobbies.

This has been really therapeutic.  I have spent 99% of my damn life trying to pretend I‚Äôm not autistic.  I don‚Äôt even know that I‚Äôm going to seek a diagnosis.  It just feels good to know.

Only a couple of years ago when I met a couple of younger students at the school I was attending did I actually want to talk and discuss things again. Games, video's, books, identities even.  Students my age didn't want to talk with me, and, thankfully, the teachers understood this and allowed me to work alone most of the time. I only ever talked with that small group of students.

I've since left that school and the group behind, and I've had barely any time to do anything about my interest. I have forgotten what I was passionate about. I don't know what I can be passionate about without being told to shut up, being interrupted, being talked over of flat out ignored.

It could also be because of the lack of support and constant criticism from everyone around me that caused me to lose my interest in my interest. I can vaguely remember some subjects, but I don't know what I was passionate about anymore. Currently a student at a technical university, I don't feel understood, and I want to be able to focus on something special to me. I hope it may calm me down in times of distress, such as the upcoming two month long period of being forced to work in groups with people I have never properly met before.

Nonverbal Autism - Schizophrenia?,"Hey guys.
I‚Äôm just wondering if anybody here has any experience with nonverbal autism being mixed with schizophrenia?
What symptoms were present, and how did you go about getting a diagnosis? 
What techniques have proven useful in helping a nonverbal person with schizophrenia when they have been manic?
Post-diagnosis, what medications have worked in the management of this?
I am asking as I believe I know a nonverbal person who may be experiencing this, however I need to do some more research before pushing through with this route.
Many thanks in advance!",autism,1580066812,CombatWombat288,5,1,True,2020-01-26
How to do the things i should do?,"I know everyone is different, and what works for one person doesn't have to work for another, but i decided to ask anyway.

I have so many plans on how to improve my life, like eating healthy, sleeping better and losing weight, but mostly spending less time on my phone and computer.

Being unable to work, i have more time than i need, which sounds great, but it also means more time to fill with less money. I know that if i eat healthy and do things other than mindlessly browsing, i get more energetic and have more mental stamina. But i just can't stop staring at my phone. Cooking is no problem, and in the morning when i wake up i don't mind cleaning the house, but after lunchtime mental stamina runs out and i well... Fall back into my childhood habits of being a computerzombie...

I have plenty of things i like, i have recently taken up painting, i'm a pet keeper, when spring comes in i plan to garden on my balcony... But i just don't do it.

Do others have this problem? And if so how do you get yourself to do the stuff you want to do? I need some ideas as a starting point so i can workout my own solution.",autism,1580069424,Aeonir,7,1,True,2020-01-26

Signs someone in their early 20's has autism/aspergers?,"The guy I'm asking about is 22. 

He gets stressed out around people, especially in large crowds. Loud noises really bother him

Tendency to blurt out (very) inappropriate things, especially when excited 

Awkward physical gestures / Stands with arms in odd positions..

Honest to a fault

Lacking personal space

Very bad handwriting + leaving own last name in lowercase and capitalizing letters in the wrong places (*ex:* Mike waRNer)

Gets very overwhelmed when many people are talking at once + overwhelmed and angry when people talk over him to the point he'll get very red in the face- will yell at them and tell them to shut up. Says he can't think when they do this

No friends of his own, people see him as weird and he hangs out with his brother and goes along with him to visit his friends. (follows his brother around like a lost puppy, although they are twins he is treated as a younger sibling)

...These are all the kinds of things that when seen separately on someone else I would think nothing of it, but after putting this together it makes me wonder

What do you think about all of this? I'm not looking to diagnose him, just any ideas you may have on what this could be, if anything, would be great

Advice on how to deal with a trigger person?,"How have some of you dealt with certain people or a specific person who is either unaware or unsympathetic of your condition and continuously triggers your negative emotions? I'm not saying everyone on the spectrum has trouble controlling their mood but for me and as far as I know most of us, it is very difficult to stay in a positive mood and resist over reacting.

My boss does not know that I'm autistic. I know that I should tell my employer but I am usually very successful at managing my symptoms and most people just think I'm ""weird"", so I would rather be treated like a weirdo than have people completely change how they treat me because they're ignorant about what autism really is. My boss knows that I'm not ""normal"" and likes to poke at me to get a reaction. He will start with ""how are you today?"" I will say that I'm good or doing fine, etc. He then says something like ""are you sure? Not feeling mad today? Are you sure you're in good mood?"" Even when I reassure him that I'm fine he will persist and tell me not to have an attitude or to stay positive just because I'm being quiet or didn't answer a question the way he wanted. If I tell him that I am being positive, he will tell me not to backtalk him or that I'm being disrespectful. I don't understand what I'm doing to make him think I am trying to disrespect him, but almost everyday I will go from being enthusiastic about getting my job done and being friendly towards my coworkers to near the verge of tears and fuming with anger because he won't stop pushing me. 

I make a good amount of money at my job and genuinely enjoy it when he is not there, but if I can't find a way to deal with this I am going to have to find another job.

Advice needed about ASD son and his college entry (UK),"Hi all, just wanted to ask if anyone had experience of this either as a parent or a child.

We are in the UK. My son is 15, has been diagnosed with ASD since he was 3, and has been in mainstream education all his life. With a few bumps and rocky patches, he has successfully navigated the english educational system and is predicted very high grades for his gcse's.

Now comes to the problem. He has an interview this evening at the sixth form college he wants to go to. He has told me he doesn't want to disclose his autism to the college. When we filled his application form in he chose to say he would discuss medical issues at the interview. 

His point of view is that he knows that people treat him differently once they know he is autistic. He wants the chance to start at a new place with noone having preconceived notions about him due to his ASD. The courses he wants to do will be filled, i think, with students like him, so i don't think he will have problems fitting in(further maths/computer science/programming). It's unlikely that any other students from his school will be going to this particular college.

My point of view is that it is extremely difficult to get support in place once a problem is identified, and he should disclose so that the structure is there ready for him him IF he needs it.

I just don't think he is ready to go it alone just yet. He still struggles with long assignments that are not broken into pieces for him. He needs extra time in certain exams (the ones that are not Q&amp;A).

I don't want to really go against his wishes, he is learning to be an adult and should have some autonomy over his medical and educational decisions, but at the same time, I am his mum and have been battling for 12 years to get the support he has needed and been using during his childhood.

I have recently been diagnosed with ADHD myself, and would always prefer to disclose to avoid the inevitable struggle to get my needs met. Had i been diagnosed in school, i might have had a different life, and I want my son to have that opportunity. I want him to have the choice to go to university if he wishes.

TLDR Is there some happy medium between making the college aware of my son's needs, and my son's need to keep his autism private? It's fairly obvious to anyone (with any knowledge of autism) when you talk to him, that he is somewhere on the spectrum.

I'm grateful for all and any advice!",autism,1580111473,blacknwhitedog,9,1,True,2020-01-27

How to read and make use of peoples expectations or just ignore them at once? (also dating),"Hey. So i come across pretty cool and people like me, but one thing about my life is just tyring for me. I occasionally smoke. Yeah, it may develop into daily for some weeks, but anyway, when people discover I'm smoking they say things like they never thought i would smoke, their view of me is suddenly outdated etc. I know many hate smoking, but i don't know how this relates to our relationship. Do they like me far less now? Or can they look past it? Should i stop completely and tell the girls who i think might be interested in me that i stopped? Is that what they would like? That i can become the image they thought of me before? Or should i just ignore these things before i waste my brain energy reevaluating things?

Another thing is showing interest in general. In my student group is a nice girl who's single like me. Another girl and a dude made jokes that we should date and as a joke we (us 4) planned our marriage. And i said to her ""you know if you have interest in me, tell me.""

But she likes to go out and is extroverted. Idk much about her opinions on stuff because we don't talk about random stuff all too much. Idk if we match for a long term thing. Can i find that out beforehand or only when going on dates? I just go on with my life and think if she's interested, she should tell me. Or am i wrong and i should search for signs? Is she expecting me to handle everything? She was a priority when i tried to figure her out some months ago but now I'm talking to someone else.

my hopes as high-functioning,"im believe im high functioning but ive found several things that indicate poor social functioning and a few things that really improve them. 

i have a hard time making eye contact but understand most social cues - but im not really tuned into others and lack social awareness. my thinking patterns would be seen as on the spectrum of aspergers.

one thing is exercise, if it affects 'gut bacteria' or simply better functioning of the brain, or both, i feel much more self-aware and aware of others. its a night and day thing, and the effects have to be maintained, not easy to do if you are not motivated. i believe something must be altering brain chemistry to a large extent and that poor sleep can make aspergers symptoms a lot worse.

another thing is pain medications, when my pain isnt as severe i feel like a much nicer person who wants to be with and talk to others. when my pain is untreated and bad i become very isolated and distrustful.

recently i heard about oxytocin nasal spray but im worried it will be hard to obtain because im not formally diagnosed on the spectrum.  i hope i can get the nasal spray because i have a really hard time coping with social interactions.",autism,1580140189,WarrenIsASnake,3,1,True,2020-01-27

NT vs Autism - Us vs Them,"I recently started a social media presence (@NeuroTD on twitter) because I wanted to start talking about topics and be able to have a conversation with others, I feel I have a lot of advice and can help, so if you feel like it could benefit you, I am there!

&amp;#x200B;

I named myself NeuroTypicallyDiverse, because I grew up believing I was Neurotypical. I learned to one. One of the main things I see a lot of is ""Us vs Them"" ""Neurotypical vs Autism"" mentality that I feel can hold us back, now of course, this is just my opinion, and I welcome others, and the conversation around it.

However, I feel a lot of people may blame NT people for not understanding autism, and as I grew up and encountered people with autism, I never understood it either. Unfortunately, it is how the world works right now, or at least has been working, I feel there is a change coming. Now I am not here to defend bad NT people, who purposefully mistreat any person, with any disability. I am concerned though at certain things I see / read.

When I was diagnosed at 32 (I'm 33 now) I actually lost all my friends, and 90% of my family. They said the usual stuff like ""You don't look autistic"" and ""autism doesn't define you because you are still the same person"" and even others telling me I'm too sensitive and to get over it. I have spent a year volunteering with adults with autism and met so many people from so many walks of life. Each person has a unique version of autism, with their own traits, complications and issues to face every day.

&amp;#x200B;

With something so complex, I never get upset over an NT person from understanding, because it is almost impossible to understand, when you really drill it down to what autism is. Do I think we should be unfairly treated, no of course not. However if autism doesn't affect somebody or their life, there should be forgiveness that they don't automatically understand what it is or how to support someone fairly. I feel there should be forgiveness for an NT person not wanting to learn either. Ultimately, they have their life, their problems, and probably a lot of things to deal with that we don't see. Much like the things they can't see us dealing with on a day to day basis. Is there room for conversation? Yes, and if that were able to happen, then everybody can grow with knowledge and understanding. Like I said though, autism is so complex that it would be difficult for any one person to get their head around (unless they are affected by it)

&amp;#x200B;

Do I think we should give up? Not even in the slightest. I just feel the power of forgiveness is more empowering to the power of anger / hate. I feel understanding our own autism, and finding our place in this world, can help open doors to conversation more naturally. The world has been set in stone for so long, that NT people are ""in charge"" or so to speak, we need to infiltrate their ranks, and make change from within! Ok, that is a bit of an extreme situation, but I feel a lot of people can limit their own growth, based on the idea of being held back by the ignorant NT people they encounter. Which is completely understandable, but their ignorance (for the most part) isn't based in hate, a lot of NT people don't mean to upset people with autism, they don't want to attack us, limit us, control us. I feel if we push back against them, attack them for their ignorance, change will be more difficult than it needs to be.

&amp;#x200B;

I do believe the world is changing, and I am happy to fight for our rights and being equal, but growing up not caring about autism was such a natural state, that it took me a long time to understand autism myself, even though I spent an entire year immersed in the culture, and learning as much as I can. Now if it takes me and my analytical brain a whole year of constant, learning and knowledge, (I literally spent 12 hours a day doing anything I can around autism) How can we expect a basic NT person to understand us instantly?

&amp;#x200B;

There will one day be a world where there is no division, and we will just ""fit in"" with society, and I am sad that I probably won't ever see that day myself. However, I want to fight for that day, and future generations. I can't do that by blaming NT people for not understanding straight away.

&amp;#x200B;

What are your thoughts? I will try to reply to as many people as I can

How should I inform my son of his diagnosis?,"My son, 8, was recently diagnosed as on the spectrum. He also has pretty intense adhd, so it took us quite a while to put a name to the behavior we were seeing. We blamed a lot of the spectrum type behaviors on the adhd. 

He knows he has adhd, but that was a traumatic process. He felt like something was wrong with him, despite all of us (me, dad, therapist, friends, etc) saying it was just like having an allergy.  You need certain accommodations, just like some kids need a nut free classroom. It's something you're born with, and it doesn't make you lesser. 

I really don't want to repeat that experience, and I'm also afraid I won't be able to explain what it means to be on the spectrum. He's also colorblind and does have food allergies, so I'm afraid this will be another thing that makes him feel different. 

I've thought about just not telling him, but I know some people experience relief at having a diagnosis and knowing what they are dealing with.

Do you ever feel like NTs care more about image than anything else?,"The title is an exaggeration, but still. 

I‚Äôve been dealing with a situation at work (in the healthcare field), and my bosses have told me to lie to potential clients about our wait times. As we do mental health therapy, a longer than expected wait could put people in a bad place. They still want me to say ‚Äúone week,‚Äù even when it will likely be up to 3 months. 

But they don‚Äôt care ‚Äî it‚Äôs all about ‚Äúpreserving the company‚Äôs image,‚Äù rather than giving useful information to help people. NTs seem to care far more about social image, and the way things make them ‚Äúlook,‚Äù than actually caring for others. 

I‚Äôm so frustrated. I would rather just refer prospects out elsewhere until we get our waitlist down. I already struggle with the social aspects of my job because of ASD, and now am being asked to do something which violates my personal and professional ethics. The stress is nearly killing me.

I've been receiving treatment for Borderline for a year but I am pretty sure I am on the spectrum. At this point does it even matter though?,"I'm 30f so pretty unlikely to be diagnosed on the spectrum, however it took me 29 years to be diagnosed concretely with anything. I was diagnosed Borderline Personality and have now spent a year in treatment but I cannot relate to other people in the group and cannot see myself as BPD when I read about it, apart from the fact I had a lot of childhood trauma.

I'm a bit upset that I will never be taken seriously by psychiatrists and may be getting treatment that whilst somehow helpful in making me recognise my feelings (I am never quite sure how I really feel inside besides good/bad) is ultimately a waste of time. I feel I have spent a life time learning compensatory skills to make up for my lack of social awareness and executive function, and the person I relate to most is my father who is extremely Asperger's. 

I'm not sure if it matters or not now and feel pretty stigmatised by my treating physicians, I don't feel safe enough to tell them I think their diagnosis is wrong. Can anyone else relate?

Disney; what was it like?,"Everyone  always asks me what it was like at [DisneyQuest](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100009853928776&amp;fref=gs&amp;__tn__=%2CdK-R-R&amp;eid=ARCEA8dLm859uklY5lOqzYubZzlnE3m333QTcrQ_CzGrp4INhBTk5vBXccN9346175_0niqpr2Ck4KCW&amp;dti=1613247188929047&amp;hc_location=group)  or at Disney at all as an Asperger's autistic man. I  worked there 9  years.I always tell them one story before I ever go on  to the bad stuff  or the funny stuff or how hard it was to pull a 10 hour  shift.

I  was working Aladdin  (Aladdin's Magic Carpet Ride, a 90s ish tech VR  game) and as I was  talking with someone in line, this woman walked up  to me from the exit. I  started to explain to her she had walked in the  exit, when she looked  me straight in the eye and said  ""You're Asperger's autistic arent you?""

 I  was for one stunned then angry, because I hate it when people see  that,  and I was about to kick her out of the ride because now I was  holding  up the whole ride, when she said (again making that hard as  iron direct  eye contact stare), ""My son, the one you JUST loaded into  that ride,  just got diagnosed Asperger's Disorder, yesterday, and he's  extremely  upset about it. We came here to try to make him feel better.  You're very  good but I know what Im looking for. Could you, talk to him  after he  gets off the ride? Tell him he can be like you, normal?""

I agreed, despite being probably the most uncomfortable that Ive ever been in my entire life at that point.

 The  ride ended, I took him off to the side, he  was kinda curious, I  gave  him kind of a personal version of the Magic Moment we had for  Aladdin,  showed him this plushie lamp we have set aside for the ride,  and told  him that it was a secret, but the Genie asked me to tell him  that Im  Asperger's Autistic, and I live just like everyone else.

Told him, ""Ive worked for Mickey for nine years, and  not one single person there knows about it except you.""  
  I wish I remembered his  name but I dont, but the kid started crying. I  was at a complete loss of  what to do. I looked at the mom, just like  ""what do I do here?"" and she  was crying too and quite useless, I looked  at the other cast member (IE  the guy supposed to be there to help me)  Aladdin 2, who was ALSO crying  (and to say you can get fired for the  way you act on stage at Disney is  an understatement to tell you how bad  that was), and like anyone in the  queue who was paying the slightest  attention was too, but the queue was  just a swath of cell phones.

I looked back at the kid, he'd stopped crying, he just said, ""So Ill be normal?""

I said, ""You will be what YOU will be. There is no normal.""

I am a 20 years old and 5 years ago I was told I had Apergers. I still live with my parents and even though they are aware of my situation they just doesn't care so I'm searching a job or at least a way to live by my own because they make me live a nightmare. They just make too much noise, they are yelling at me when I'm in a middle of a meltdown/suhtdown which makes it even worse, I can't talk with them about my struggles because for them ""it's just in my head and I need to move on"".
I need to find a way to relax and get away from all this negativity but I feel like I am controlled by my senses and axiety.
In the past I used to deal with it trough meditation, and I had a really nice job at a theater, and I was a volunteer at a musical/theater/singing company which is my only hobby (these people really took care of me).

"Sister is an addict, scumbag, and I'm basically at a lost. Advice is welcome","First thing is first, I'm sorry for all the typos. As you read through this, you might be able to tell why I'm so stressed out, and why I needed a place to ask to advice while venting. This event has messed with my parents and my brain in a negative way.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Long story short, I'm high functioning autistic. While I have several degrees, getting a job is extremely hard and holding one due to the massive need of social skills makes it about impossible. Because of this, I'm an early 30 something living with their parents. (The up side is I'm always trying to find ways out of my situation)

My sister is a few years older, and ever since she was in her early teens she has been involved with the ""wrong"" crowd, and she has abused something. It started with drinking, and then it moved on to pot, and then to harder stuff later in her life. I can count somewhere between 20-30 times where my parents had to pull her out of the fire, make sure she doesn't have a DUI, and so on. Once when I was in middle school she was involved with a massive drug head that was into underage girls (keep in mind she was underage at the time). Since my parents lived in 2 different states due to their jobs. My mom picked her up in handcuffs and got her out of that environment. During the time she was with me, she drugged me to knock me out and that away the guy could have sex with her pretty much next to me.

Anyways, a number of years back my sister gotten away from some human trafficking, drug smuggling, xyz guy. I'm not entirely sure about everything since my parents did their best to keep me out of it. But when she gotten her after a good 2 weeks, her true self started to show. She broke every rule my parents gave her (don't steal, show respect, no drinking, ....). However, during this time she was seeing a therapist for the first bit, until she stopped going to him. After a good 6 months to a year things gotten so bad between the death threats, yelling, physical abuse, emotional abuse, and so on. My parents ended up evicting her from the house. During all of this, my sister told lies about my parents and me to the rest of the family (grandparents, cousins, etc. All that lives several hours away, and while we didn't have the best relationship. We did hang out once in a while when we went to them.)

Some of the lies included my parents beating her, my sister seeing my dad masturbate with a sock, how we committed real crimes, and so on. Instead of coming to us, they just believed her. I mean all but my grandparents on my dad's side which she never talked to since they are religious.

For a number of years after, we didn't hear anything from her and my parents figured she might've been dead. Because my parents were so sad, I used a little of my money over the years to have someone investigate her, and they found she was alive but back in another drug den. During this time I was working on one of my degrees, and within a psychology class they talked about false memories. Basically, you can have false extreme memories put into you, or you can put them into yourself. One common method is by the person taking drugs, watching something on TV, and thinking about someone or something. Say they are watching someone get sexually abused (porn, TV, etc) and they think about their dad while they are super high. Depending on the person's brain and how often this happens, they will make a false memory of their dad sexually abusing them. I figure maybe this is why she said what she said, but still. Outside of my grandparents on my dad's side. No one would talk to us, and everyone treated us like trash. To the point where my grandparents met my parents and I at some beach place over a weekend. We went to the area my granddad grown up at, and I met family I never seen before. When we got back to my grandparent's house, my dad's sister came over drunk accusing us of kidnapping them. (the so and so accused me a number of times of hacking my grandparents since my degrees are in IT and cyber security. She lied to them saying some tech person said they traced some hack back to me. When my grandmom asked me about it, I told her that she is crazy, and she just accused me for breaking a federal law.)

A number of years later my sister made a kid with the SOB she was running with. Some of the family that was accusing my parents and I over things she lied about told her to tell us. Long story short, they forced her to visit us 1 time with the kid. Before this, when asked NONE of my family would even tell us she is alive. We knew they knew due to the investigation that was done on her. But acted dumb to figure out who we can trust.

Anyways, a good year or 2 she gotten my mom to believe she wanted out of that environment. She refused to do anything when asked to help. A few years later, and she made another kid with the SOB. During this time my grandmother on my mom's side went there and bought her stuff which allowed her to stay there even longer. They even argued against her moving out of there. About 3 to 6 months later she told everyone her son told her that his dad drunk is pee while they were shopping at a target. This gotten my parents in high gear to get her out, and a few weeks before she was meant to come here she nutted up. Basically, she blown up on the guy and told him how she was going to screw him over. It turned out he was taking hidden footage of her, and he got the cops to kick her out. Because at the time it was in the middle of the winter in a very cold place (not naming), my parents rented her a hotel space even against me arguing against it. My reason for arguing against sending her to a hotel so quickly is she hasn't hit rock bottom yet, and in her mind she will always have a safety net. My parents argued she could've died. During this time she looked for any place that isn't a homeless shelter to stay at. All the ""friends"" she had didn't help her at all. (Later, she said she was homeless during this period, but admits she was at the hotel.)

During this time it was told to her to get a job. Because they guy put some restraining order on her, she used that as a way out of that. Eventually she gotten into house cleaning, but I have no doubts she was doing illegal stuff on top of that.

About this time, her problems kept increasing and it became harder for my parents to hide my sisters past from me. It turned out the guy she was with was in human trafficking, he is majorly into drugs, he pimps under age girls, he hurts people, he was/maybe is still in gay porn, and so on. Because of this, I figured out what is the rush to get her and the kids out. For about an entire year later the guy just gave up on the restraining order. He also OK the kids to come here to another state. Secretly the plan was to get the kids here so we could do a custody battle. However, the rule was she couldn't drink, smoke, do drugs, and she had to be respectful. Anyways, over a weekend my mom quickly bought the plane tickets, went there to get her and her stuff, and got her out of their. During this my mom found used drugs all over the place, a mess all over (to the point where there was dog crap all over), and so on. On top of that, the guy kept accusing my sister for having sex with other guys and saying the kids weren't his (i think this is why he OK them to come here).

SIDE NOTE: It turned out the parents were just feeding the kids yogurt, milk, and chicken nuggets from McD. They weren't allowed to see the doctor, the kids when they first came here looked like holocaust survivors. Later when we took the kids to the dentist we found cavities in both their mouths. In fact, nearly every last tooth. Keep in mind at the time one of the kids was around 1.

After she came here, she already broken 2 of the rules. No smoking and be respectful. I complained about it, but basically gotten a shut up. After the kids came here we gotten them into a psychologist. The youngest we couldn't do much with since they were too young. But the oldest was labeled with PTSD. It turns out the dad took the kid out to the woods, and other guys paid him to f his kid. After this, we gotten the kids in some pre-k program which has helped them a bit.

During the time when the kids started pre-k, my sister was forced to get a job. During that entire experience, it was a nightmare since she was constantly fighting them. I've even used my contacts in thinking maybe she was at least off drugs and drinking, and a few places said they would hire her with a starting salary of $20/h with full benefits. All she had to do is work front desk for some doctors office. She lied to me in saying she applied, I checked, and found out she didn't apply to a single place. My parents didn't really care, and used her kids as a reason why that job and the others I had lined up wouldn't work. Something about she needed to be able to take care of her kids. The problem with this is I was the one taking care of them since the mom was literally sticking her kids in a high chair, and walking away for hours (to my guess to get high).

Around this time some of my family that blamed my parents and I for a ton of stuff came here uninvited. During their stay, I kept running into them talking bad about us. So basically they came here to just stir the pot. This is even them seeing pictures and getting a detailed report on what my mom seen when she was out there.

Eventually my sister gotten a job at target, and her drinking kicked in high gear. I brought this up to my parents, and they changed the rules saying she would be kicked out if she drink on the property. Even with me showing them the bottles, they didn't care.

About this time on, nearly every day I'm awaken by my sister screaming at her kids, my parents, the dogs, or herself. Pretty much every day around 6 or 7 pm my sister starts attacking my parents. At one point it gotten so bad that I went in to defend them. She started recording me, while keeping her kid out of the frame, and acting 100% calm. This told me she was up to some stupid stuff (from what I heard the same stuff she did to the guy). So I started recording her from a different room when she started her attacks. My parents blamed the environment she came out of, but later on we found it's just like last time. After that and several cops telling us to make sure our security system is up to date. We replaced all the cameras in the house, and there is a ton of footage of her blowing up with audio. Sometimes flat out yelling at her kids for no reason. Sometimes using her kid's PTSD as a shield, while blowing up when it was brought up to her attention. A number of death threats, a number of insults, a number of times blaming everyone for something that clearly didn't happen, and so on. Literally saying ""hi"" to her has set her off.

Around this time my sister started to flat out tell me about some of the crap she did. Stuff like making $80k by moving drugs and people with the guy. For those of you who didn't pick up on it, this means she 100% knew this was a bad person before having her first kid. And she decided to have 2, stay with him, and even today threaten to take her kids back to him.

During this time, I started to notice that whenever she had a TV on, it was of the ID channel (murder porn). The death threats came in more frequently, but worse is. She was having both her kids watch that. At this point I started taking the kids out of the house or room when possible when she blown up, when she was feeding them murder porn, and when it looked like something was about to happen. This is seen several times on camera.

A while later the dad started his BS by saying my sister stole the kids. His state ended up putting out a warrant, and he took it to the state I'm in. He went to the cops, and the cops said the warrant doesn't apply here since it's out of state and he needs to get one for this state. He went to the court, and was able to get a hearing without us knowing about it at all (which means the judge went against my sister's constitutional rites). The cops who picked up the kids told us what to do, and my sister and parents went to the local court house. The judge called it a learning moment, and that he would reverse it if the judge in the other state would reverse their ruling. We gotten the judge in the other state to try to call ours, but he wouldn't talk to her at all. From the looks of it, since the judge in our state did what he did. The judge in our state had to reverse it to get the warrant removed. From my understanding, this never happened. But somehow the lawyers were able to get the judge in the other state to put out a warrant for the guy a few weeks later. More than less, the judge wanted the kids in foster care for a week to figure things out and the warrant was meant to be to arrest him if he resisted this. We guess their state messed it up because they guy has warrants in other places, or he is apart of some ongoing investigation (there is a bit of evidence of this being why he never went to jail for his stunts. Where they are after someone bigger, and they need him in play for now. **The DEA even told us they were ready to move in on him once he killed my sister, and they knew about much of what he did**.)

Something to note, during the time when the cops were around the dad's parents house. This lasted for multiple hours. My sister was drunker than drunk, on drugs, and she was physically and verbally abusive. To the point where my dad still has a cut on his nose where my sister thrown a hose at him. On top of that, when we tried to get everything together to make this happen. She fought us and the lawyer every step of the way. It turned out the guy was at a local gas station a few days before picking up the kids. He was causing so much of a thing that the cops had to be called on him. Even down to getting written statements, paper work from the school, and so on was a nightmare due to her. Every second of it I heard how stupid we are, how she knows better than everyone, and so on. If I had to give it a number, 95% of the time she was drunk, high, or both. During this she tried to get herself fired from work as to my guess as some messed up reason to not have a job. And then to top it off, she was drunker than drunk when her kids finally came back.

During this time before he went to jail for a short period, he tried stupid stunts like tricking the phone system into thinking one parent was texting the other in asking for a copy of all the conversations with the guy. For those of you who don't know, when you send a text it basically acts more like a normal mail in the box. Change the location where it came from on the letter, and whomever is getting the mail will think someone else sent it. But the idiot obviously thought any reply will go back to him, when in reality it just goes to the person you said it came from.

Anyways, the judge ruled the kids to be under my parents care with the guy having pretty much unrestricted access to the kids. But my sister has to be monitored. He gotten off by telling the judge in his hippie state that it was believed his mom was dying, and he went to one of their houses. Even with it proven that this is a lie. The judge didn't care. The kids came back with some rash, and a bit set back.

Around this time I started figuring out my sister is a sociopath. She shows no remorse, it's all about her (to the point she leaves her kids in a high chair for hours when she gets bored of them), it seems to her going to jail is just part of the game, and she tries to manipulate those around her as seen above. I told my parents about my theory, and they agree there is a high chance this is true. I was told once everything is said and done, she will be looked at.

A little bit later the guy told the court we neglected the kids because they have ringworm. During his time with the kids, he went to the doctors and told them what to write. The morning before he tried to use this, we took the kids to a doctor to see what the rash was about. It turns out some soap wasn't acting nice with their skin. Even with this pointed out, nothing happened to him. And then it was pointed how he lied on stand multiple times, and again nothing happened. The only thing that changed is the court said he can contact the kids by x service when he doesn't have them.

The first chance he gotten, he gave the oldest a burner phone and he forced everyone to use some other service. Other than our lawyer yelling about this, nothing happened.

For whatever reason, the lawyer told my mom that it's best if my sister shows up in court in person. The lawyer who my parents already paid somewhere under $50k during all this let it slip up that she wanted this. My sister threaten to end it by giving the kids back to the guy, leaving, and so on. She called my parents cheap, some cuss words, and how they are horrible parents (this honestly happens a lot). At this point my mom in a quick hour bought the tickets and what not. Even still my sister was still going off on my parents. This put everyone in a bind since who will take the kids to school and what not. When we were going out to pick up the kids from school, my mom asked her mom (one of the main people who came to the house to say crap about my parents). During the call I was able to overhear most everything since the volume was loud. My mom's mom said all of this is my mom's fault, how she caused problems, and xyz. Even with this, my mom asked her. About 2 or 3 min in the trip, I told my mom this will cause a war and she will snoop. She might even try to sabotage what my mom is doing. My mom gotten mad at me, slam on the breaks turned around really fast, and drove a few feet from the car in front of her. Every time I told her to slow down, she threaten to wack the person. (Something I haven't said before, but everyone's stress level is to the max due to this. I've seen my dad, mom, and myself cry for hours during separate times. But I seen how my sister doesn't care at all.)

The following days my sister brag how she was going to go shopping with the lawyer, and do each other's hair. This is in between my sister telling my parents the lawyer is laughing at them and the rest of the family is laughing at them. To top it off, she really stop trying to hide her drug use. Like she did it behind doors, but we could 100% smell it. And it is important to know she was doing drugs with the kids in the room with her. Around this time I mentioned how I could just watch the kids. My mom OK it after teaching me how to change them, and my dad worked something out with his work so he would be in the area during those days. We found with the mom out of the picture, the kids became more than less normal. During the last day the mom video called and talked to the oldest. After few a few hours, he acted like how he does when his mom is around (kicking, hitting, talking down to everyone, etc. Keep in mind he isn't even in normal school yet).

Anyways, during the same day the oldest gotten sick for some reason, and we (my dad and I) had to change him. Because my sister forced my mom to do all the packing, laying out clothes, and so on on top of taking the kids to school and the doctors. We couldn't find any socks. I was told it was in my sister's room, and my dad went in every draw looking. My dad found vodka in the closet, I found what I believe to be a crack pipe in one of the draws, and we found some evidence of used drugs in a few draws.

BTW I would like to know what it was. It was wrapped in tin foil, burnt on 1 end, and it looks like she smoked it from how it is rolled up. I also found a vacuum bag that obviously had drugs in it at one point. The last time she was here, we found a similar bag when she was kicked out. It turns out smell of drugs doesn't really go past the bag.

While in the other state, my sister went on the stand and was able to get everything but 1 thing thrown out. The judge said they were going to figure something out by today (over the weekend). As soon as my sister came back, she spent about a good hour with the kids. After she took off to buy drugs and what not. The next day my sister took off for some time, and my mom started cleaning her room. She found a ton of stuff under the bed. She told me to not say anything. I didn't.

The following day (today) I've been having to help with the kids like I normally do, and help my parents to make it easy for them. I found out they haven't decided anything in the court case, and might not ever. My grandparent on my dad's side called me to see how everything went. I tend to keep them somewhat in the loop. While they can't do anything, they tend to be good moral support since they are religious. Today, this happened to be something that set me off. Normally they say leave everything in the lords hands or pray on it. Because they always been so poor that they seriously have to think when spending literally $5. I tend to look the other way and not get really into things.

I don't know why, but this just made me PO. It might've been that I needed someone to talk to. It might of been that I've been told by cops and others this guy could shoot up the house. It might of been me having to invent an entire security system, and we actively use the cameras due to my sister. It might of been all the stuff in the past. It might of been me constantly being told soon this will be over, and getting yelled at when I try to get anything more exact. And so on. But I started arguing with them saying my sister needs to clean up or get out. I even mentioned how she is currently doing drugs. When they pushed back, I said she costed us x amount and she is still going out of her way to do illegal activities like drinking and driving with her kids, getting drugs, and so on. They argued that none of the money spent was mine. I blown up and said I spent $5k. They fought me on that, and I said I spent it on a investigation. After which I blown up about most everything. How I had to spend 2 or 3 days fixing a clock she slam off the wall because she was PO and drunk, how I have to stop what I'm doing every few seconds to watch her kids, how all of us (my parents, and I) broke down crying multiple times, and how at that second my sister called my mom a C because my mom who hasn't stopped didn't make them a pizza yet. A pizza she bought on government money when my parents already buy everyone food, gas, etc.  
I don't think my grandmom heard a 3rd of what I said since she didn't reply when I told her I was sorry for getting mad. But she flat out hung up on me. After a few hours of bringing myself back down, I tried to call her but she wouldn't pick up. When I texted her about me being sorry for getting mad and the situation is very stressful, she told me ""Life isn't always easy, We know Jesus Loves us &amp; Will always help us... Read Psalm 23""

I didn't reply, but to me this felt like a massive middle finger. Like I know I need to just let it go to keep my only family outside of my parents. And that it really doesn't matter at the end of the day. But, I want to just sit down and force them to watch all the footage and ask how is your praying going to work? How is that kid getting f in the woods and the 1 year old being f in a hotel related to what they told me. How is it that I went well out of my way to not have kids, not be involved in anything illegal, and to do my best to have a good life that helps others, but having to deal with this. How is praying fixing that? Maybe God wants us to act. In doing so, she is clean or she is out.

But of course that would completely kill any family I have after all of this.

Anyways, any tips will help. I mean outside of doing something illegal, drinking, moving out, or going to a shrink. The reason why moving out isn't much of an option is I've explored that option a bit, and just getting a job is a nightmare during normal times. During this event, you might as well forget about it. And just moving without a job will mean to me being homeless. Which means death since I don't have the mental ability of putting up with that long. Talking to a shrink is pointless since they can't fix the actual situation. Like they can't get me a really good job in the area, they can't force my sister out without major problems, and they can't force my sister to act straight without major problems.

TLDR: I've been dealing with a sister on drugs and what not for a long time, she has kids that were raped by the dad, my sister and the kid's dad was in nasty things like human trafficking, and I basically feel like I have no choice but to die or deal with this.

Learning to let myself be autistic,"I know the title sounds weird but I will explain what I mean.

I was diagnosed at a somewhat young age, around 7, but it's taken more than a diagnosis for me to come to terms with what this means to me. At age 1, i could fully recite every word in a book my mom read to me nightly without even knowing what reading was. On my first day of elementary school I realized I was different. When my teacher suggested that I get screened, I think she already knew the answer, but she was kind and willing to work with me. 
By middle school I had learned of the cruelty of others and tried to lay low. Fifth and sixth grade I took the same supplementary math course in place of P.E. Music and writing were strong points, but I wasn't versed in socializing with people who don't know how autism works. 
By seventh grade I was isolatory and critically depressed. I could not speak because I didn't think anyone heard or understood.
By freshman year I had recovered somewhat, but the anxiety of new situations took over. 
Sophomore year I began to take part in what I like.
Junior year I allowed myself to be closer to others.

Now just last week I reactivated my 504 plan and proposed a project for autism advocacy. I'm mentoring two students, in the office of class secretary and openly allowing myself stims, headphones and my therapy object.


I've always been so scared of what people say and do that I never allowed myself the tools that I needed to thrive. I didn't want anyone to see me as any more different than I already was, so I learned to act and to mask and to suppress it all. 

But if I ever want to see a change in the world, and if I ever want to be happy with myself, then I need to accept what being me entails.

Allow yourself to rest.
Allow yourself the resources you have.
Allow yourself to just be.
This fear will pass one day, just take it one step at a time.

Allow yourself to be autistic.
You just might grow to like it.",autism,1580198179,ghostybun21,22,1,True,2020-01-28
Jobs screening for autism,"I have recently taken a few autism screening tests, and they had similar questions to a lot of the online job application assessments that I've taken. Questions like 'do you work better alone or in a group?' On the job applications, I would usually just say what I thought they wanted me to say because I didn't want to be denied, but after taking the autism tests, I can't help but wonder if they are trying to deny people with autism. Maybe it isn't intentional, but that idea has really been bothering me, especially because I have always been scared to answer honestly.",autism,1580201992,Huntybunch,15,1,True,2020-01-28

"I think I was misdiagnosed by mum mum. A professional never diagnosed me, and the label just makes me miserable","I‚Äôm 17 and ‚Äúam diagnosed‚Äù with a thing called Pathelogical Demand Avoidance which is basically where commands give you anxiety. I was ‚Äúdiagnosed‚Äù when I was 8.

I live in the U.K. and no one has heard of this thing and the label has always made me feel different and the odd one out but I don‚Äôt present as having it and I appear to be neurotypical. 

My mum is absolutely fixated on that I have it and we have argued over it for years. She tries to relate everything I struggle with back to PDA (like saying motivation issues are because of your PDA when I‚Äôm depressed or lazy). She has also once said I ‚Äúfreeze‚Äù when she tells me to do something and she ‚Äúsees it in my eyes‚Äù and I was SO disgusted and mortified at this bullshit she was saying because she basically makes it up and half admits she doesn‚Äôt know what she‚Äôs talking about. I follow through on commands around the house MOST of the time she just only noticed the rare times where I say no. 

I don‚Äôt actually have any of the official symptoms when you google them. Symptoms are stuff like ‚Äúbeing extremely comfortable in role play and pretence‚Äù and some PDAers have imaginary friends they spend 20 minutes talking to a day ‚Äî- this is completely NOT ME and I don‚Äôt want anyone to find out I have PDA because it‚Äôs completely not me. 

I have showed my mum in the past year that I have most of the symptoms of primarily-inattentive ADHD and more than enough to be diagnosed and I think I have it. The doctor even gave us this official questionnaire and my mum and I filled it out together and she agreed with what I was putting down on the sheet, and it really seems like I have ADHD. I like reading r/adhd because I relate with a lot of the stuff there. Also if I get diagnosed with ADHD there‚Äôs actually a community I could be a part of.

But then she said I was just trying to ‚Äúcover up‚Äù having PDA and she felt betrayal because I was trying to disagree on the label she‚Äôs put on me for years. She really believes I have it when all my symptoms are ADHD symptoms. She thinks I have PDA because I can‚Äôt meet deadlines etc, but people with PDA have a thing where they almost automatically say no to all commands without thinking about it and I definitely don‚Äôt.

My mum has said before it would be hard for me to get an ADHD diagnosis because ‚Äúyou see, you‚Äôre already diagnosed with PDA‚Äù but it‚Äôs not actually on paper anywhere and my mum just doesn‚Äôt want me to get diagnosed with something else. I think it‚Äôs so much more likely I have high-functioning autism (I don‚Äôt present as having it because I‚Äôm so high-functioning but I do have some traits of it) and ADD.

I have told her ‚Äúat parents evenings have my teachers ever said I was disobedient?!‚Äù And she has said ‚Äúin school you probably just do as your told to not get found out as having it by the other students.‚Äù

And I‚Äôve shown her videos of me as a toddler following commands even when the person doesn‚Äôt say ‚Äòplease‚Äô and doing as I‚Äôm told. To have PDA you have to have avoided commands from a young age. 

The things she thinks are PDA symptoms are: my general anxiety, lack of motivation, not being able to concentrate, being talkative, being distractible, being lazy as in never tidying my room (she says I can‚Äôt deal with the silent demand of tidying my room), completing work at the last minute and procrastinating. I feel like she just says everything is PDA. She also went through a phase of calling me ‚ÄúPDA kid!‚Äù when I was about 13 but she has deeply and meaningfully apologised for this.  

I have NEVER identified with this diagnosis and it has just made me miserable. I want to get diagnosed with attention-deficit disorder because A) people have actually heard of it and even though people don‚Äôt have a full understanding, they will at least not think you‚Äôre unusual B) it could actually benefit me because I could get medication which would really help me with school C) I wouldn‚Äôt mind telling my teachers because it‚Äôs ALL THE EXPLANATION THEY NEED because I have ADHD symptoms, and if they look up PDA they will just think I think I‚Äôm a cat which is NOT ME and I CANT HAVE PEOPLE THINKING I DO THAT. 

My mum for years has been trying to make me think I have PDA but I just don‚Äôt identify with it. She has bought books (I just went and wrote on it all the things that are completely not me saying ‚Äúyou know your daughter!!!!! You know this isn‚Äôt me!!!!!‚Äù) and left printed out pages on my bed for me to read and I throw them away and get so annoyed.

Then today I found out PDA isn‚Äôt even diagnosed in the U.K.! It‚Äôs not recognised enough as an ASD profile.  Therefore I‚Äôve had this label placed on me only by my mum and not a professional that has made me feel depressed and like I was just different when I could have had an ADHD diagnosis and been happy with myself and got medication and things would have actually made sense. I said to my mum ‚ÄúI just found out PDA is not actually diagnosed in the U.K. I have never identified with it and the label only makes me miserable. There is no benefit from a diagnosis - no medication, people wouldn‚Äôt know what it is if I told people I had it, and it had a load of weird sounding symptoms I don‚Äôt have. Therefore I identify with it even less and I want to just forget I ‚Äúhave‚Äù it.‚Äù

My mum will never change her opinion and I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll still be arguing about it in years to come.",autism,1580210964,gnataral,20,1,True,2020-01-28

How were your school years as a child/young adult with your autism?

When I finally recovered a bit from that burn-out I started realizing... not 1 day in my life did I look forward going to school. I dreaded every single time that I had to go to school, I hated each and every single day I was at school, and I couldn't wait to get back home. Even now I still have nightmares  about school a couple times a year.

Long travels and change,"17/F

Every year me and my family travel to the beach during summer break and spend about 2 months there (that's how long vacations last where I live) it's absolute hell but I can cope with it since I've been through this my whole life.

I have some hobbys like sewing and coloring books but my main source of entertainment is gaming, I play league on a daily basis and Minecraft and don't starve together with friends on weekends, since I didn't own a portable computer I just accepted the fact that I would be incapable of playing videogames for two months or so.

But this year I got a notebook as a gift for entering college on November and it felt really exciting cause I would finally be able to play games during summer. I live with my mom and I have a special table where I play every night, it's really relaxing and usually it's my ""alone time"" of the day. The problem is, I don't have a table in here and that is causing meltdowns, I haven't played a single match since I arrived (about a month ago) even though I have a portable computer now bc not having my table with me makes me super nervous. I don't get my alone time anymore and when I manage to cope with the fact that I don't have my table and start playing someone interrupts me and kills my mood, causing me to turn my computer off immediately.

Autism and death,"I accepted long ago death was part of life. I find it more or less normal, and having a random component such that when it's time, it's time. I find this exceedingly hard because other people are very sad in the face of death; often so sad they get upset at you for not being sad too. Relatives die? I attend the funeral and wear black and force myself to hug a million strangers and distant relatives who expect it, but I don't really ""feel"" a loss like like the verbiage in the eulogies. It was just their time. Pets? Not a fun day to be sure, but they're little and don't live as long as people and we all knew this going into it. People on the news I've never met? Random murders somewhere? I literally not only don't care, but don't know how to care. Someone in their 20s gets run over by a truck while running across the street. The news has people crying and going on about how unsafe the street is and how much more life the person had. I genuinely don't get that. Myself? I would never harm myself don't get me wrong, but I'm just not worried. When it happens it happens.

this is my second psychiatrist, after a one of session at my parents place last year, but both times people have told me that i am ""too social"" and ""too empathetic"" to be able to have autism. within an hour of knowing me, which is frankly, not enough time to know the facets of an individual.thanks

&amp;#x200B;

even though i get often over stimulated, don't know how to make appropriate eye contact, find it difficult to recognize that someone i'm close to is upset, have meltdowns, sometimes exhibit selective mutism, play video games so i can be in a place where i can keep everything under control. I also struggle figuring out my own emotions and explaining why i feel a certain way and what upsets me. i lack insight in myself, but because i am paradoxically aware of it i seem to undermine my own argument whenever i make it. 

&amp;#x200B;

so far all signs of overstimulation and emotional outbursts due to that have been chalked up to anxiety and everything else is just explained away by me being a perfectionist.

the problem is that i have studied psychology linguistics and anthropology to improve my ability to read and understand social situations. so i'm afraid i'm autistic but have gotten so good at masking that i'm never going to have my issues acknowledged. i just want to be heard and get tested.

Help approaching the topic with parents/my doctor?,"Hi, I's suspected for awhile now that I'm on the spectrum, from my sensitivities to light &amp; sound to little tics and obsessions over the years. I was wondering if anyone has any advice on how to broach the subject with my parents and pediatrician, as I'm still a minor. I'm currently 17, and my main concern is my parents sweeping my request under the proverbial rug (as they've done with my depression, panic attacks, etc. for years). Should I just wait until I'm an adult considering their previous reactions to my struggles? Or should I try and tell my doctor beforehand so they could inform my parents? I'm honestly super  nervous to bring this up to them after they've ignored my mental health for over two years, so any advice and ideas would be super appreciated.",autism,1576806473,EmperorDanny,6,1,True,2019-12-19

I got officially diagnosed as high-functioning. I'm not sure on what to do now. (Serious),"A few weeks ago, I was given an official diagnosis from my therapist/psychologist of high-functioning autism. It definitely explains a lot as to how I interact with people, my surroundings, and I guess why people tended to treat me odd. 
If I'm being honest, I thought that if I got a worded out reason as to why I felt so detached and different from other people, that I could tackle it and finally overcome it, to become... ""normal,"" as my parents would put it. 
I didn't really... grow up in a household that acknowledged mental health issues, that they were all just ""excuses."" My family even used autism as an insult to me whenever I ""overreacted"" or whatever. 
Taking this into account, I was basically told that I am exactly what my family hated when I was younger. I guess this makes me very unnerved, knowing I am on the spectrum. 
What do I do here? Even though I know why I'm different, I feel even more lost than I did. It probably sounds harsh, but it makes me feel like I'll never be able to be that ""normal adult."" That I'll never be able to truly speak what I'm feeling. I know that autism isn't a disease, that autism doesn't make me less of a human, not even close!

Online Test Question had me Stumped,"I was just taking one of those online adult autism tests.
I was trying hard not to think too much about the nuances of the questions and trying to answer them using my first gut reaction ..

It was,

When I see my loved ones upset, this is how I feel*

-flat face
-frown face
-angry face

My first gut was to say flat face. Which isn‚Äôt really true. But it‚Äôs probably slightly truer than picking frowny face.

Dreams that feel like years,"So I always have bizarre dreams and I don't even have to be asleep long for it to occur. Sometimes I may only be asleep for 30 mins but I'll have my most imaginative dream. But that's not the main topic of this. Have you ever had a dream that's felt like it lasted years?

Every now and again I may have dreams that feel like a day or two but rarely I have a dream that feels like its lasted years. Last night was an example of this. The dreams that last years aren't usually particularly good and what makes it worse is I can remember every part of the dream so it feels as if I've experienced a few years. When I woke up it was the most disorientating experience because I had just lived the life of a different dream version of me and now I've returned back to my normal life as if nothing ever happened. But to me so much has happened.

Does anyone understand what I mean? I really don't want to be the only one in this. The experience itself is already so lonely.",autism,1576827397,CodeyA6969,8,1,True,2019-12-20

I know a friend who acts strange.,"I go to college in Japan and I have this one Japanese male friend. I don‚Äôt know anything about his mental condition.  His actions remind me of behaviors I can somewhat relate to, since I have mild autism. 

When he communicates, whether it‚Äôs through voice or text, it‚Äôs very difficult to understand him. His grammatical structure is often wildly incorrect. (He would use the wrong post-position, or make incomplete noun-verb pairs, for example) and he repeats the same phrases. (Examples: ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt have to if you don‚Äôt want to.‚Äù; ‚Äúit‚Äôs an honor to ~~~.‚Äù; ‚ÄúIt is very cute and lovely.‚Äù (idk what he‚Äôs talking about); ‚ÄúOh no I shouldn‚Äôt have said that.‚Äù ) He is ALWAYS smiling very hard. He occasionally uncontrollably laughs, or keeps on talking about irrelevant concepts until someone stops him. Also, he doesn‚Äôt seem to understand some basic acceptable social behaviors. (Examples: Cutting in line at a bus stop; Touching other people‚Äôs belongings without approval; talking too loud during class; starts running ahead when we are walking together) Also he loudly greets ‚Äúhello,[name]‚Äù to his acquaintances whenever he sees someone.

I feel that he just wants to hang out with me, but he has disturbingly poor social skills. I try to make a comprehensible conversation with him, but he often says some gibberish or makes rudely uninterested gestures. I‚Äôm worried that if I abandon him as a friend, he will feel lonely, and also lose significant experience in social interaction. I often see him together with 2 other socially and mentally uncommon people.

The reason I am making this is to clear up a major misconception surrounding autism. I should know about my own diagnosis even if I am 13 as it is important. Autism is passed down genetically and causes an imbalance in your brain. If your parents have autism you are much more likely to get it. To my knowledge my parents do not have autism but my dad may. My dad and I have been thinking of getting a test for him so it may be where my autism comes from.

Autism has afflictions with the brain and the brain only. There is no correlation or causation on vaccines and autism. Autism when mild is easy to deal with as long as you have me-time. School is often, not always but often terrible for an child's mental health if they have autism. Just a few tips. Autism should be treated similarly to how being deaf and blind. We can still do things but we need a bit of room. People with autism have special interests, basically what this means is that we get hyper interested in a very specific field. My special interests are Sonic the Hedgehog and the Ancient Maya Civilization. Play to these special interests when teaching you child. I am not a parent but I am a child with the affliction.

Finding gifts for others,"Christmas is around the corner, and for adults who are autistic or aspies like myself, trying to think of gifts to give to others can be a challenge. 

Even when I get a list of ideas from the people who want a specific gift, all sorts of nerve wracking things come to mind. Why give them a specific thing when I could instead go and help them get the thing themselves so they know precisely what to get? When I went to a co-op store, I could take a box and fill it with precisely as many grams of chocolate raisins or banana chips as I wanted. 

And then to get someone money or a gift card, well, they are likely to give something of the same sort of thing back to you, with the end result is that the person who gives more money gives away as much as is the difference of the amount they gave minus what they got back, which doesn't make much sense as a gifter giving someone like my dad who knows exactly how to acquire something and where to get it, how to customize it, and have it arrive at his office the next day.

I know well that I'm overthinking this, and know that other people are happy to get gifts of many different things, but it makes it really hard to go and commit to getting something for someone else. And it makes it maddening to think that someone else might be able to read you and get you what you want and be unable to get them something you really think they want and are unable to get for themselves. 

I think I'm going to go to a store that sells the general types of things I know a person likes like my dad's love of South African milk chocolates and get the first thing on the shelf, or go to a book store, find the section of the genre the recipient wants, and get the first thing I can find that is age appropriate and in the series they like.",autism,1576929067,Robert_Jarman,6,1,True,2019-12-21

5yo Son HATES singing...I'm a singer.,"So about 6 months ago my son F started doing this thing whenever someone would sing...he would make this groaning/humming noise and then yell ""stop singing!"". 

Thing is, he loves music. He's fine if you sing along to a song on tv or the radio, but if you sing anything at all, even a song he loves, he gets very upset. Now if you even hum a note he'll yell ""stop singing!"" Until you stop. We've mostly gotten used to it, but the thing is that I come from a family of musicians and I sing in bands. I always sing. So does my other son J (nt, 11yo) and he sometimes teases his brother and does it on purpose. I have tried to explain to him that F is not being a brat and that it genuinely bothers him (I compared it to having an itch you can't scratch) but he still does it.

Recently just learned about the differences of autism in women. Is it worth seeking a diagnosis? 22F,"Hello,  
I'm not really sure where to start with my suspicions about probable ASD. I'm 22F, and I recently started looking into autism in women prompted by a youtube video recommendation. (That sounds silly I know.) This prompted me to do further research about some characteristics in autism in women and some of the following fit me to the T:

\- Deliberately picking up social cues or phrases to mask how awkward I feel or so I can try and continue the conversation- Forcing myself to make eye contact with others (I thought everybody does this?)  
\- I have a really difficult time making friends and being socially competent, despite me taking action and going to meetups  
\-Sometimes I have fight or flight response modes when talking in groups of two or more, it gets so bad that I stutter when I talk. This has become quite disruptive in my day to day life.

\-Getting really anxious over any social interaction I have e.g. ordering food

\- Getting really over reactive when changes plan spur of the moment.

The reason I was put on SSRIs at 5 was because I guess I was a bit of a problem child. I would self harm by banging my head against the wall, I would cry and not talk to anybody in class, I would watch the same things over and over, I would get aggressive really quickly.

I'm wondering if its worth seeing someone to get a proper diagnosis? I'm really keen to go anyways to limit my growth inhibitors as a young adult, but I've never found something that's ticked so many boxes for me before.",autism,1576943709,Sleepissues45,7,1,True,2019-12-21

Aspie with Anxiety and Depression Trying to Decide Between 2 Job Offers,"BACKGROUND:
I‚Äôm a 28 y/o male CPA with 3 tax busy seasons in public accounting (large and briefly mid) as well as 2+ years of experience in corporate in a blended tax and Ops role. I particularly enjoyed the latter for a time, but around the 2 year mark it got boring. Recently I moved to a large southern city from a large midwestern one. I‚Äôve got 2 job offers and am trying to figure out which is right for me.

Both roles are in tax: one at a small CPA firm paying in the upper 80s with a bonus that brings it to low/mid 90s, the other with BankUnited paying in mid 80s with bonus bringing it to upper 80s. 

COMPARISON:
The small CPA firm has been around for over a decade but doesn‚Äôt have reviews on Glassdoor/Yelp. I‚Äôve seen some negative reviews of the Bank and that there have been a bunch of layoffs over the years. I once had a real bad experience from major lay-offs some years ago and don‚Äôt want a repeat. 

The small CPA firm has supposedly better work life balance than the big and mid-sized ones but busy season is still busy season. I‚Äôd get my own office there and an opportunity to work from home one day a week though (they provide the equipment). Up to 4% 401k match, they pay for 50% of medical dental and vision. 

The BankUnited role doesn‚Äôt have a busy season and probably has me work no more than 45-50 hr weeks. The people I spoke with seemed nice. They seemed to have some flexibility in work schedules; they told me your work is your work so as long as you get it done you can take time for a weekly doctor‚Äôs visit or something along those lines. The small CPA firm  said they were okay with a weekly doctor‚Äôs visit too.

ISSUE: I found out a few months ago I have a mild form of Autism formerly known as Aspergers. I also have issues with anxiety/depression that aren‚Äôt as severe as they‚Äôve been in the past thanks to medication but are still an obstacle. Having a ton of things come at me at once results in sensory overload and I can‚Äôt function. I‚Äôd likely need some disability accommodations to get by in either role. 

I‚Äôm also concerned about super harsh, toxic people, as my depression basically adds gas to the fire. The small CPA firm worries me because past experience in public accounting really did a number on my mental health, and never want to go through that kind of agony again. On the other hand, BankUnited‚Äôs reviews and layoffs worry me. 

Advice on which to take?

Just finished my testing for autism. VALIDATED.,"So, on Thursday and Friday, I traveled two hours from where I live, rented a room, and spent two days having my brain picked apart by a neuro-psychologist (I think that's the correct term. But from now on I'll just call her the Doctor. Cause she is...so yeah...)

Here's what I learned after all the testing. First, mental tests are every bit as exhausting as mental tests. After the second day I was so overwhelmed that I physically didn't know if I'd be able to drive home. I ended up sitting in my car cooling down (literally) for an hour before I started driving. 

I don't have all the results yet but she did a lot of scoring during my breaks and she also did an IQ test that I got the results for right away. I am REALLY smart! I was honestly shocked, even though I've always had a modicum of intelligence, I've always done terribly in school and the idea that I could be as smart as the test says I am is mind boggling.  Without giving out exact numbers, all but one of my scores were above the 90th percentile. I am not genius level but still. The one score I did not score high on was processing speed. Duh. Which brings me to my next point.

I have ALWAYS used the phrase 'Smart but slow' to explain to people that I needed a minute. If you give me time I will figure it out. But if you are timing me, my brain is going to freak out and I'm going to fail. It was honestly INCREDIBLY validating to have the data in front of me and have someone saying, ""You are right. This is real.""

Honestly I cried more than once during this testing.

The doctor told me that she saw all the signs of autism (formerly known as Asperger's) (She said I ticked every box.) during my testing, and even though we don't have everything scored, she said she had no doubt what the results would be. Which was great because if I had walked out of there without an answer I don't think I would have made it through work the next day. 

I am 28 years old, and my whole life people told me that I had debilitating ADD (Now ADHD-PI). Now I know that my ADD was never debilitating. I just had autism and no one saw it. (Because she's so smart!!!)

There's a tiny bit of anxiety that this doctor may call me back and say, 'I was wrong. You don't have it.' but I'm sure she won't.

This is huge for me. I'm going to post more but for now I just wanted to share that I have been validated and I definitely (almost-confirmed) do have autism.",autism,1576984809,HopefullyGinger,25,1,True,2019-12-21

I am curious about the autism spectrum disorder and wanted to ask a few questions?,"Hello, all. As the title says, I have questions about the autism spectrum disorder. Firstly, I hope all my questions or thoughts come off as respectfully as possible. I get very curious about types of diseases that affect the mental health and even development, aside from my own. 

I have OCD, ADD, depression, and anxiety. I know that illnesses have a bit of range such as mild and severe. I take one medication for all but ADD. Some people with all my same illnesses take more medication, less medication, or have several form of assistance to cope.

That being said, I have read a few medical guidelines about the autism spectrum disorder and it prompted to want ask a few questions directly to those affected by it. Because while the explanation and breakdown was very informative, it of course highlighted that each person is uniquely different in how their symptoms are presented. 

Again, I am not at all aiming to belittle. These are questions coming from a place of curiosity and wanting to learn, so if I cone off offensive, please let me know. 

My first question is if autistics are aware? I don't know if severe autistics can be, but I feel those with high functioning can? Are ALL high functioning autistics aware?

Do severe autistics have any chance of small independence?

I know there are 3 levels and I mostly got the general explanation of high functioning and severe but what might classify mild?

How are autistic taught in special education? I understand they're taught to be as efficiently independent as possible but what are they taught?

Is it common for autism and other mental issues like depression or bipolar disorder to overlap?

Do autistics take classes that train them on social queues?

Do autistics have tics such as those with OCD and Tourette's have?

DAE else struggle with understanding a late diagnosis?,"37 m and received diagnosis of ASD and OCD about half a month ago.  Still trying to come to terms with it. I was diagnosed with ADHD as a child but it turns out that it was an 80% chance that it was a wrong diagnosis according to the Psychologist who evaluated me. The OCD came as a shock. I don't feel that I have obsessive thoughts but I think the truth is that I just never noticed them because I never knew to look for them. Now that I do, I can see how it fits but can't always recognize the thoughts. Evidently, my need for perfection is just OCD. Between OCD and ASD, I'm not sure what parts of my behavior and thoughts are my personality and what belongs to the conditions. I can't talk to family about it because my Mom would only use it against me and my siblings don't get it or deny it. I have no friends to talk to about it either. I'm not sure how to move forward with this information because I don't know what it means. I'm stuck in knowing what parts of my behavior are the conditions and which parts are me. At least I am scheduled for therapy and he said he will help with OCD, feeling recognition and social skills. I wonder if that is enough to make me ready to live  independently?  I wonder if that will be enough to know how to keep my job and not get fired or quit it. I look back at my life and I'm just sad how it turned out.

I get hyper fixated on stuff. But not for long. Maybe 4 months at a time. But during that time I learn everything about it and I eat, sleep, and breathe it.

I fidget and stuff but I always thought that was due to anxiety.



Idk. Sometimes I feel like my doctor made a mistake, but then I think and I realize, maybe not.

Sick from work due to autism issues. Management are Angry and unsupportive.," I have been experiencing problems with my autism and anxiety at work and taken time off work to avoid stressful situations. Unfortunately my bosses are very angry with me despite not giving me any support from day one when. I disclosed my autism and how to support me.

I work for a big supermarket chain that claims to be disability friendly but has given me no support since I started in August and I had my store manager call me to reprimand me for my illness. I asked to have a one to one meeting with her and some others in management but she refused and then started asking me some very awkward questions over the phone.

She asked me why I should be treated differently to other colleagues (in an unfriendly tone) it's too busy to be talking with me and giving me regular feedback. She doesn't understand what I need from them. Asking why I havnt talked to anyone (I did just every manager was 'too busy' to listen) telling me I'm still on probation (which I wasn't she has just been misinformed or too lazy to check details of which colleage she was calling) 

I explained about my autism and I'm currently experiencing a lot of panic attacks causing hyperventilating and vomiting. And she was just angry with me which then made me worse and cry on the phone. I've decided not to even go in tonight as I feel the way she talked to me was out of order. I had tried for a long time to make them aware im struggling just to be ignored and now it's a major issue im the one in the wrong. 

Im worried im going to be fired. but last night I wrote a document highlighting my issues and triggers plus how I asked to be supported when I first started my role. What has happened and how I've been treated. I also included references about how to support an autistic employee from the NAS website . Outlined the major points I brought up again and again just to be ignored. I referenced the website of the store I work at highlighting their various values on autism and disability awareness. Also included references to the equality act.

I printed a copy and saved one to my computer. I'm contacting my union rep in the morning to discuss what my options are and have the document as something I can refer back to if the managers decide to try and spin that i am lying.

Helping my son,"Hello,

I am hoping for some advice. My son is on the spectrum.  He is about to turn 9, does amazingly well with his school work, but has issues with behavioral and social norms.  I'm sure nothing new there.

I'm struggling with giving him some level of independence and responsibility while being a ""good parent.""  I suppose part of parenting is letting them fail while being there to help them back up.  But I worry when he ""fails"" onto others and their reactions.

The story:

Today was a hard day for him, for reasons I'm unsure of but it seemed to be from the time he woke up.  Oh well, everyone has bad days.

He did avoid us most of the day, choosing to mostly parallel play or read near us until he played with friends and his dog out back.

Fast forward to this evening, and my real reason for the post:

He asked if he could walk the dog tonight.  The dog is new to us, a puppy, and needs to be walked often.  We were happy he wanted to be a part of this, but he asked to go alone. It was 9:15pm, a borderline time to be alone outside. But, we live on a military base with 25ish houses in a small circle.  Everyone knows everyone, the base is closed entirely on weekends... it's as safe as you can ask for. We make sure he is bundled up, knows how to work the poo bags and has his cell phone and a flashlight.

15 minutes go by and he comes home and says the dog hasn't pooped yet, can they keep going, and also some complaints about how the doggo doesn't like to walk on the grass. We agree he can go.

20 minutes later we are panicking because he hasn't come back, but also a quick look around outside and calling him and he hasn't come home.  We know he wouldn't go with someone etc but are slightly worried he's hurt himself climbing or something. 

Finally he walks in, right before 10 and before I start calling neighbors.

Turns out he got tired of walking the dog and decided to knock on friend's doors to show them the puppy. Two didn't answer, one invited him in and introduced the puppy to their dog, and the final one yelled at him that it's way too late for this and to go home.

Now I am all in a tizzy. He probably upset a few neighbors.  Confused a few friends. And he is mad at us for trying to explain that it's too late for that (how was I supposed to know?!?!).

So I'm hoping you guys have advice. 

I can't explain every social norm and rule. I can't never let him do something like walk the dog (although now he knows he can't at night alone, he will have to take a grown up) and I'm worried the parent who got mad at him will not let his kids play with him anymore.  Should I be more helicoptery? Should I back off and accept that things like this will happen and just deal with them as they do? It seems more common as he gets more independence but where do I draw the line?",autism,1577073567,superstegasaurusrex,11,1,True,2019-12-22

Largest study of its kind reveals that many psychiatric disorders arise from common genes,"[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/12/191212142634.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/12/191212142634.htm)

&gt;Many distinct psychiatric diseases share a common genetic structure, according to new research by scientists at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, an international team of investigators. Psychiatric disorders affect more than 25 percent of the population in a given year. In the largest-ever study of its kind, published in the journal *Cell*, researchers identified more than 100 genetic variants that affect the risk for more than one mental health condition 

Here again we see it is becoming clearer that ADHD and ASD are expressions of gene variants. Although the article does not go so far I maintain that at some point they will understand how autism and ADHD are related.

&gt; Certain disorders shared many variants, allowing the researchers to divide the conditions into three groups of genetically-related conditions: disorders characterized by compulsive behaviors (anorexia nervosa, obsessive-compulsive disorder and, to a lesser extent, Tourette syndrome); mood and psychotic disorders (bipolar disorder, major depression and schizophrenia); **and early-onset neurodevelopmental disorders (autism spectrum disorder, ADHD and Tourette syndrome).**  

The interesting thing is that dopamine is a major factor in ADHD and Tourette Syndrome and I believe in ASD as well. Dopamine is a red line though these conditions. This article and some others like it point to why we share many symptoms and impairments with ADHD and why many of us are diagnosed with both of them.

I think we are approaching the end of the classical psychiatric differentiation around diagnoses. That at some point the genes will determine what someone has and that treatment will be aimed based on biology rather than psychiatry. 

That may also mean that we can get rid of, at some point, of the term 'mental illness' for some of these diagnoses: there is no such thing when it is simply a case of aberrant DNA, mutated genes that cause these conditions.

And it also tells us something about the whole concept of determinism and choice when much of who and what we are is controlled by these genes, leaving a person with limited options in life.

And for that reason I have no ethical qualms about phasing out autism by repairing these genetic variants as early as possible in the fetus. Genetic mutation leading to suffering is not a goal of evolution.",autism,1577123715,Vaidif,3,1,True,2019-12-23
Figuring out Air Travel,"My son, 3 years old, was diagnosed with Autism last year. Honestly, it's been very hard. Harder than I think any of my friends or family realize. I'm so glad he got diagnosed. We have our primary doctor to thank the most, she really insisted on seeking Early Intervention services and full evaluation. We had put it off as we kept hearing about other parents where their child didn't talk until about 4, and they turned out fine. With better understanding on our end, classes, therapies, early intervention, and good daycare he went from utilizing 10 words last December to full sentences this December. All of it has brought me to tears more than I'd like to admit, both from frustration and joy. I'm not good at asking for help, especially when I don't know what to even ask.

I'll put what I'm asking in bold.

My wife enlisted into the US Air Force, and will be graduating from boot camp mid-January. She has wanted to do military service since before we met, and I fully support her decision. Being a Marine veteran myself, I understand the drive. The hardest part for her, is definitely being away from her son. Both our son and I will be there. My mom will be traveling with us to help, as best she can. What I'm having a problem with is **what can I do for assistance with airports and flights**? **What am I not thinking of**? We can barely afford even the basic economy seats, so can't upgrade. **We can't have him wait in a long TSA line**, the longest we've ever kept calm in a line was about 10 minutes. **Is there an airline that's really good at helping**?

Even with how far his communication has progressed, we're still working on emotions and processing. He's not able to express what might be frustrating or bothering him yet. Things like earplugs, headsets, or muffs are instantly rejected. I can't find a late flight to try to sleep through it, so **entertainment for about 6 hours**? **What if he he has a meltdown**?

I'm so overwhelmed and scared of flying with him. Years ago, I'd just find the best flight I could and pack my bags. **If there's anything that's highly recommended to purchase**, I can make a little room in the budget.

How i got my ears to not hurt from loud noise,"Me, being mildly autistic it was hard to bare loud noises. My friends make fun of me all the time but i do the same to them too its how we keep our friendship strong. We do that alot and i know there joking around too. Well they use to make fun of me covering my ears from loud noises but for the past 4 years, they noticed i dont do that anymore. They asked me why i dont cover my ears anymore. Mind you my ears still hurt from extremely loud noises. What i told them is that i listen to music very loudly through my ear buds. Most people say that its not good to do that it can still damage your ears. But i always tell them, that 1. I dont have them super duper loud just a bit louder then normal volume is set at. And 2. I dont care if my ears hurt a bit, pain makes humans stronger and we learn from pain too. Its still risky to do this to myself but for past 2 years my ears haven't hurt from my ear buds being too loud. Im not saying you have to do this method but if you wish you dont have to cover your ears then slowly turn your ear buds up a bit every month or so. Keep doing this until your ears dont hurt from the noise. If you want to you can get apps on your phone or laptop/computer to make it where the volume extends more making your phone louder.

"Does any of this ring true? (First post, please help, I have no one to talk about this)","Hey guys. First post here. I'm just a guy trying to make sense of a constant rattling in the back of my head and would appreciate any help with this. Maybe find a friend to talk to... and listen to... that would be a dream come true.

First of all, I want to clear out that I haven't been diagnosed (I never consulted for this in particular). Even though I fall within the spectrum, I never considered myself autistic (even had a bad experience with an ex who sought out an autism diagnosis to the point of clearly changing his own behaviour to fit). I always thought hey, I can recognize facial affection like no other, nothing autistic about that. Yet there are many other strong signs that I can't keep ignoring, especially memories and even video recordings of my childhood and feelings and social issues that have plagued my whole life.

I don't call myself autistic, but there is something there inbetween ADD and AS / sensory issues, I won't name it yet. I don't think I need a name. And it's hard to find psychologists who work with AS in my cesspool of a country, which considers that anything other than psychoanalysis is bullshit... Anyhow, I don't have a diagnosis but I recognize myself in so many stories that I can't keep ignoring it.

I guess I am writing to see if I can find some support in my first step into researching this and / if I should do something about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Why I think I'm in it:

&amp;#x200B;

* Many developmental signs since I was 1. I spoke really late and have taught myself to read and write by the age four.
* By the time I was three a Dr. suggested my mom that I was showing many signs of autism.
* In school, without wanting it, I was the best of the class without having to study, much to the ire of high achievers who worked for it.
* Never did any homework (and still won first place).  Couldn't write anything in school. Now I think back on how I was forced to spend so many years sitting in a classroom having to pretend I was listening, and it makes me mad.
* University was hell due to not having integrated the school studying process and also couldn't bear the Humanities bullshit. Had to switch halfway through from Literature to Linguistics. (My country is far more rigid with the curricula, you choose your major before starting and stick with it)
* I want to be hugged yet hate it / give the most awkward hugs.
* I want friends / lovers, but getting close to people tends to be a disaster. I never really get close and it just stresses how unlike them I am, how impossible for me is to be the real me and communicate my real ideas, that the only way to sustain that is acting a part. But I don't like acting so I isolate myself. I know there are people like me, it's just that they're probably doing the same thing I'm doing.
* There are parts of my body which experience violent tremors which feel like ""painful tickling"" if touched lightly or breathed on (once I slept with a guy who got offended at me avoiding his literal breathing down my neck. He just hated me and left and I couldn't explain how unbearable the tickling is).
* Got in trouble with neighbors / police / lost lots of money moving out of a place I had just rented because I couldnt live / sleepnext to a fucking beagle that barked all day due to being left alone in a backyard and that I still want to kill (both dog and shitty owners) even though I love dogs.
* When the dog thing happened, I printed out 200 flyers with screenshots of the dog barking (I had collected a library of videos) and left them in the mail in every flat in the building to see if anybody else wanted to do something about it. I only had one reply from a woman who said the dog was destroying her life and she wanted to shut it down, a fellow sufferer. I decided to lose the fight and paid a lot of money in legal penalties and moved out. I laugh about it now, but I went through this less than 2 years ago.
* Went to the movies with a guy and within 15 minutes I asked him to leave with me because of a high buzzing tone in the cheap sound system that was driving me crazy.
* This is embarrassing, but I somehow spent my life thinking most people are ""psychopathic"" in a way, because I think of them as fake in many social situations where I feel nothing and so I say nothing. Just to name an example, if someone reveals they're going to have a child, I don't really feel anything and somehow project my own indifference onto other people celebrating as being fake. This happens with a lot of social interactions. On the other hand, if someone is crying I feel it right in my gut and I have to force myself not to cry with them. The fact that other people can see people crying and not react just reminds me of how unlike the others I am and it makes reality uncanny.
* The feeling mentioned above got so big, at one point I had a depresonalization - derealization crisis that lasted 2 years and comes back every now and then.
* I also tend to think people don't like what they like. Especially with music. It doesn't matter if they are my friends. I see them going to 

&amp;#x200B;

What deterred me from thinking of myself in the spectrum? Mainly, the message I internalized is that there's something EXISTENTIALLY WRONG with me. I don't know how to explain it. At some point I had this idea that I was a ""monster"" who couldn't see himself as one, but people were reacting like they were supposed to, who could blame them? I don't get rejection all the time. But there is something about being funny, ""quick witted"", that I have managed all my life as a tool to win people over, because I have always thought of myself like this monster that has to make an effort in order to be likable. And even though I got good at it, when people get close, they sometimes can see that moment when I'm tired or drained, and the facade comes off, and then they back off. This is my perception of course. The only times I managed to talk a little bit about it, apparently the reason why some people don't get closer is that they see me as ""aloof"" and self sufficient, when I'm actually painfully lonely and very often suicidal...

There's a whole lot to the story (I mainly left out all of the abuse... don't really know why). But with such a long post I feel lucky if you make it this far. I know I'm just a pixel, but I exist and I want to throw my message in bottle. There's just too much underneath and I don't talk about it. Maybe you're there, friend? Maybe you understand?

Special interests,"My husband and my son have special interests. They are both somewhere on the spectrum. My husband‚Äôs is anything to do with exercise science or working out, especially weight lifting. You get him started he becomes a jabberbox!  My son‚Äôs is everything and anything about World War II. Especially atomic bombs but also tanks and airplanes from then. He uses references from WWII in everyday conversations he is so fascinated. Like I was so excited, I almost dropped another bomb on Hiroshima.  Which I don‚Äôt get because he isn‚Äôt violent and thinking about Hiroshima and atomic bombs makes me sad but he gets excited. So anyways I think I have a grasp on what special interests are due to my guys limited love and interests in their respective interests. 

My question is, can people who are not on the spectrum have special interests. I have always kind of wondered if I am also somewhere on the spectrum because of some other struggles I have but those could honestly maybe be from PTSD from childhood trauma. However, I have a special interest!  I literally could talk all day about psychology. I have had people mention how I am a walking psychology textbook. I can‚Äôt retain much information about much anything else but learning about psychology really just sticks in my brain. I don‚Äôt have to work very hard to remember it either but any other subject, I really struggle to retain info.

I am feeling a bit sad about the gift that i chose for my younger brother. (Details in post),"I doubt that this is the correct subreddit for this, and i slightly doubt anyone will give much attention to this but i'll post here anyway as i assume it's caused by/related to my autism...

10 years ago when i was 7 years old, i got a cool present on Christmas Day. It was a Spider-Man truck that opened up to reveal a car playset with Spider-Man themed cars and a New York City themed play area. I really liked that present.

Today, 9 years and 364 days later, as a 17 year old, i have decided to find that same toy online and have it delivered to my house to give to my 5 year old brother tomorrow on Christmas. I have it in my room now and i *really* don't want to give it to him. This will sound rude and mean, but i feel like it's a waste.

I am a big Spider-Man fan. It's my ""special interest"". It's the only thing i can hold a proper conversation about. That is to say, answering questions *and* asking questions, normally i just do the former, and i don't do a good job of it either. But with Spider-Man, it's actually good. 

The toy is in the box, and i *really* like it. The box bears all the markings of early 2000's Spider-Man merchandise: The Mark Bagley artwork quite literally copied from the covers of Ultimate Spider-Man comic books, the dark blue background with a light blue web pattern, the incredibly nostalgic Spider-Man font, written in bright yellow with red shadows, and the red borders on the box with black Spider-Man emblems dotted along it's surface. 

I know that he will get an unnecessary amount of presents tomorrow, and he also doesn't understand how much i liked this toy, so it's just annoying to me.",autism,1577204484,Leekheadd,3,1,True,2019-12-24

Good part time jobs for people on the Spectrum?,"So, after my cruise in January I'm finally going to start looking for a job. Im 18 and just graduated highschool last June. Right now I know for sure I wouldn't be able to do jobs that involve intense customer service (like cashier, waitress, etc) at the moment because I freeze up and I can't focus within an environment with a lot of sounds going on, it becomes overwhelming. I also can't handle multiple tasks in my head at once. You have to wait until I'm done the first thing, or give me a wide time frame that I can work with. 

I've talked with my mom before on this and she suggested I work at my local Wawa (convenience store). She is very considerate about everything, it's just Wawa is extremely close and we are very familiar with it. Yeah I know the people there because we go there often, so that makes it easier, but I don't think I'd be able to handle that kind of work environment yet. And that kind of puts a damper on things because that's probably the most common and usually easiest job for most people to start off with.

Like for example when my grandfather died or when a relative or a close friend died I didn't really care or bother to care.

My friends say i am like a robot, or talk at the same pace all the time with the same pitch. My dad is also very clever, around 140-150 IQ so if i inhereted his iq maybe that is the reason why i am a bit too weird?

I dont have any friends , never did.

I am a attractive male above average height, i do do a lot of sports. People asked to be friends with me but always declined idk why, i just said i dont want friends they are a bother, so they all just left. 

I am 15, 5'9.5 (So not that tall, but expected to be 6'1)=which i think is very ideal.

I am also INSANELY FUCKING SHY for some reason, i can't even order food or ask for water even though i would be starving. 

I also speak very fast, my imagination is very very good, ugh i am good at pattern solving but i am not that goot at school, i do have a excelent long term memory but short term memory is i guess average on most days some days below average :/

I have done many sociapath quizzes online also autism quizes they all came with positive but tbh i dont trust them.

Could I possibly have autism?,"I'm 19 and AFAB, and I never questioned whether or not I could be autistic until a few weeks ago when I started seeing posts on TikTok about autism and realized that I related to a lot of them. I've always had a very hard time talking to people and making friends and I still do, but I thought this could just be because of my anxiety. I find it very hard to express my thoughts in ways other people understand and understanding social cues is something I've never been good at but again I've always contributed this to anxiety. I can't understand sarcasm at all unless I've been around someone long enough to learn when they're being serious and when they're not. Same goes for figurative language like, ""Write it in blood"" 

I like to think I'm empathetic, but the more I think about it I'm really just able to understand where people are coming from with their emotions but not necessarily understand the emotion itself, so I have a hard time genuinely feeling bad for others even though I want to. I've always been seen as weird and ""different"" when I was in school. Funny enough I always thought my peers were the weird ones. I just can't understand people in my age group for some reason.

I guess in a way I do stim? Something always has to be in my hand (preferably my right hand) whether it be tissue, a pen, a piece of paper, just anything. When I don't have something in my hand I feel anxious. I also have a terrible sense of direction. The only way I can tell what's left or right is because I know I'm right handed, so whatever is on the side of the hand I write with is the right and so on. Trying to get me to differentiate north south east and west is a lost cause

I do have special interests though they change frequently (about every four months or so) and they're usually music related. I spend hours learning about new genres and the history of them and such and when I'm really into it it's literally the only thing I can talk about with other people, but I've always perceived this as something normal like simply being enthusiastic about a hobby. 

I hate changes. Doesn't matter if it's minor or major, if anything about my daily routine changes it feels like the world is ending. I hate having my things rearranged, stores changing their layouts, restaurants changing their menus, blah blah blah you get the idea. 

A lot of these things I used to just think it's because of anxiety since I have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, but the more I do research about autism in adults the more I have a suspicion that this could be more than anxiety. But I want to hear your thoughts. Is most of this just anxiety like I originally thought or should I consider seeing a doctor?",autism,1577240980,yearofthesnitches,2,1,True,2019-12-24

They invited me out to happy hour last week, I went and had fun. The two girls added me on Facebook and I noticed that my other two coworkers were on there through the mutual friend suggestions so I added them. The one declined my request and I‚Äôm just annoyed. I don‚Äôt particularly like her but we‚Äôre nice enough with one another and I just thought it would be cool to be friends with each other on FB like the others. I‚Äôm so offended and pissed off. But I can‚Äôt just text her and start shit, even though that‚Äôs my first inclination. 

So I just deactivated my account and deleted my IG too. I‚Äôm giving social media a break- it just makes me feel left out and lonely. But I‚Äôm worried that this will alienate me if the new workFB friends think I blocked them or something. I might mention that I‚Äôm giving social media up if it comes up, but if they don‚Äôt outright ask me, I don‚Äôt want to just bring it up. Idk. This stuff is so stressful! Is the one just a jerk? Has anyone else had a similar situation? I don‚Äôt want to find another new place to work again because I already switch jobs a lot and it‚Äôs starting to look bad for me. Honestly it always just comes down to the social aspect for me. It‚Äôs so frustrating because I need a job to live! And no matter where I go, there‚Äôs women like this! I‚Äôm just feeling discouraged and looking to hear if anyone else has dealt with similar situations.",autism,1577258095,justtrowitindabag,0,1,True,2019-12-25
Question regarding signs of autism,"Hi

So I am on the spectrum, though I haven't told certain members of my family yet. I was diagnosed a few months ago.

I was at my cousin's house earlier in the week, and she mentioned that she thinks her sister (my younger cousin) has autism. One of the main reasons she thinks this is because the girl 'changes her mind a lot'. One day she loves you, the next she's bringing up hurtful things and saying you caused them. One minute she wants to go do a social activity, the next she hates that hobby.

Is this a sign? I've read various websites and I'm not seeing this anywhere. I do agree that the same girl has trouble reading social cues, but this particular sign confuses me.",autism,1577262577,Falling-in-a-forest,7,1,True,2019-12-25

I need advice,"First of all, English is not my first language, so excuse me if I commit any mistakes.

I dont really know where to start. 

Ive felt different from other people my whole life, and other people have told me that I am ""peculiar"" a few times.
I am too sensitive. Loud noises, crowds, bright colors, squishy food... Those are things that have always bothered me.

I was diagnosed with social anxiety and general anxiety disorder when I was a child, and I left school as a teenager because I couldn't stand being in a classroom with so much stimulus all the time (after that I was home schooled)
Ive always felt like I didn't belong, although I had and still have friends. But most of the time I think I was just masking to fit in.

All this makes me think I could be an autistic person, but Ive never been diagnosed and no one ever told me that I could be one (Ive visited many psychologists and psychiatrists during my life, but Ive only been diagnosed with anxiety and depression)

The idea of being in the spectrum makes me feel at easy and in peace with myself, but I dont want to self diagnose. There are traits that I don't share with other autistic people:
I started speaking and reading quite early, I understand sarcasm and use it ALL the time, I dont find it difficult to understand what other person is feeling or thinking...

Long as hell post. In summary, I just want to know if I am an autistic woman or I'm just overanalyzing myself

Holiday dinners and being pressured to eat.,"When I'm in someone else's house, especially when it's for a family gathering, I don't like to eat. Even if everyone else is. It's just so uncomfortable. Standing in line to get the food. Feeling like everyone is watching what you put on your plate and then watching you eat after (even if neither happens). Feeling the pressure to put food on your plate fast enough so that people aren't waiting behind you, even when I'd rather take my time to choose what I want to eat (I usually freak out and just put whatever on my plate just to leave the area faster). And then being guilted into eating even when I'd rather go outside or sit in another room away from it all, because since everyone is eating I need to also eat. Since I have kids, this has made it easier but it's still so stressful. I can focus on getting their food. Focus on making sure they eat. And then when they're done, which is a lot sooner than everyone else, I can leave the area and go where they are. So usually I eat very last, when everyone else has already eaten, or not at all.

But still...like today. 5 different people told me to go fix a plate, while I was watching my kids. My husband, thinking I was only not eating because I was waiting on him to watch the kids, told me twice. I finally had to tell him to stop pressuring me. And kinda explained it. He's amazing and instantly dropped it. But everyone else just pushes. Like, maybe I don't want to eat when you eat? Maybe I ate before specifically so I wouldn't be hungry and feel like my body needed food.

I'm so glad that most of the holiday gatherings are over with for me. We have one next week at my dad's and then we'll be done for a while. Every night this week I've gone to bed so exhausted because of it all.

"Indecision &amp; acting out, autism traits?","Our 3yo daughter will be tested for autism next month but we suspect she is on the higher-functioning end of the spectrum. Lately she has been fascinated by the idea of putting some toy or object in our face while nearly yelling, ""Take It! Take It!"" in a very forceful way. If we motion to take it she cowers back, holds the object close, and softly says, ""No, it's mine, it's mine.."". Most times we simply say, ""No thank you,"" until she stops. A few times we've taken the object, to try and teach a point (we know better now) and she yells, screams, and loses it, then starts crying and saying, ""Sorry, sorry...sorry!""

Social and relationship issues.,"I have been diagnosed with ASD for as long as i can remember, so i come to you with my problems. I can't think my way out of this box by myself and hope that is okay.

I got abused by both my birth father and step father for most of my life, conditioned to obeybor get hurt.
I have an ex, we were together for four years.
I was raised religiously, but not as heavily as her.

Finding her made me believe more and i was happy for most of our relationship.

What i did not like was her family trying to convert me to her branch of christianity.
They (perhaps unknowingly) hooked into the years of abuse and threatened to take her away from me or say that i was'nt good enough of a christian in the way i was raised to be with her.

2 years in i proposed to my ex and she said yes.
Her family made sure she never took it serious due to the way i proposed
(Withour their permission, etc.)

After 3 years i was finally out of my stepdads grasp and free of his abuse.
I noticed the abuse from my ex's family more and got depressed.

Meanwhile my ex was also getting more depressed and seemed to wanna end it more and more.
So 3 months after she tried to break up with me i finally caved and ended it before one of us ended ourselves.

We decided after a while we wanted to be friends because of mutual likings and our common friendgroup.
It took me 2 years to try, and i still haven't made big steps in it.

6 months ago she found someone new and i want her to be happy.

But i also dont know how to react to it.
I feel like my autism and anxiety keep me.back from finding someone new myself.

And then on friday when we all went for dinner with friends, she brought her ""new""  boyfriend. 
Who, of course, ends up sitting next to me.

The entire evening was great, tho i did'nt talk to him and kept to my best friends sitting across from me.

And then when i finally got into a conversations with them about cartoons and how she could convert him to a nerd if he has a secret liking to it, he made a remark about how converting mw religiously didn't go well.

I did not know how to respond so i sorta laughed it off, but i ended up feeling pretty hurt by it.
Not juat that he knows but also that she told him about our relationship.

She was my first and i don't know wether that's normal to talk about.
I also know she sees it all differently and as good will from her parents side.

I really don't know what to think about it all or how  to just let it go.

Christmas experience with 5 year old.,"This Christmas was my daughter‚Äôs first Christmas where she got the whole deal about Christmas (be good, get on the good list, get presents, open them, etc).  We opened some presents Christmas Eve and she did ok.  But the next day she refused to go downstairs and the fact that there were presents there and candy (she‚Äôs a candyholic) wouldn‚Äôt budge her.  

She is verbal but still struggles with pronouns and anything beyond need-based language.  She has worsening social anxiety - this is characteristic of her‚Äôs that is deepest in the spectrum.  

She can‚Äôt really tell us ‚Äúwhy‚Äù yet. Just that she doesn‚Äôt want to.  So, I have to guess why this Christmas was so hard for her.  My guess is that it is because she knows that she has presents to unwrap and there are a bunch of family members (some of whom she doesn‚Äôt know very well) that are going to watch her, which makes her the center of attention - which is something she hates, hates, hates.

Autism&amp; empathy in a neurotypical world,"It has been said that autistics lack empathy but often it is the neurotypical that lacks empathy toward the autistic &amp; when the autistic truly tries to be empathetic towards the neurotypical they get brushed off as if that is something the autistic is incapable of. 

A little acceptance can be in order here as well as training as to how to best display empathy toward neurotypicals. I believe this could go a long ways to helping the autistic person to be able to interact with neurotypicals on the empathy front. 

Often times we autistics even can have intense empathy but not know how best to display it. If our attempts are always shut down then we can end up actually shutting down empathy wise &amp; not be able to show empathy at all. Even if we may feel it intensely inside. We end up having to stuff it due to repeated rejection. Then we become cold &amp; just want to be left alone or worse become mean spirited.

I am at a point in my life that for the most part I just want to be left alone. I have suffered emotional , verbal abuse the last 16 years &amp; physical as well as sexual abuse as a child. I am ending my current relationship due to emotional &amp; verbal abuse which has resulted in physical trauma due to the intense stress I feel around her.  

I have very few friends which may be a good thing as I can't handle spending a lot of time out with others. Most my friends I have known for years &amp; know what I'm going through now &amp; are supportive of my attempts to get out of this relationship. It is sad that it has come to this. 

I really tried to be empathetic with this person but instead of her accepting my empathy she would verbally &amp; emotionally attack me. Eventually I shut down as far as being able to show empathy toward her as I couldn't wait to get away from her when she started talking of things that would pull on my empathy heart strings. At this point I became cold toward her in terms of not being able to listen to her. I had lost my desire to do so. 

Now days I spend almost all of my time in my bedroom which I put a lock on to keep her out so to minimize my exposure to her verbal abuse. I ended up calling adult protective services after my stroke which is not the first such trauma related to stress in order to try to get some meaningful counselling for our relationship but she just says she doesn't need counselling &amp; things became worse as a result of that call so it became even more clear I need to leave this relationship.

"Advice needed, for a Mom with a child without autism","I need to ask a question for mothers or people intimately associated with children with autism or special needs. And not be judged for my lack of knowledge or approach to this situation.

The TL;DR: 
We‚Äôve known a couple for over 12 years. They played a giant role in our lives, even in our wedding. We‚Äôve been close and also not close with them, in a peculiar way, since their son was born.

They had a son 8 years ago and he was nonverbal and clearly autistic (almost anyone would be able to check every CDC ‚Äúbox‚Äù just interacting with him for a half hour). The first signs for me (I have a degree in developmental sciences) were leading up to a year. By year 3 or 4, they told us they took him to a therapist but then lied about the kind of therapist and medications he was put on and told us that he just had bad ADHD, which explains the no talking. We didn‚Äôt have kids, but I studied human behavioral science so I knew enough to ‚Äúknow.‚Äù
We even looked up the medicine they told us he was on, since it was unfamiliar, and saw it was off-label used for autism.

Gradually, between ages 6-8 he talks a little. A few word phrases, movie quotes, or parrot repeats of what others say. 

Now we have a girl that‚Äôs about to be 2. She‚Äôs talking and interacting with other kids. She watches him intently when she‚Äôs around him because he behaves so differently than what she sees at her daycare.

Their son is the pink elephant in the room any time we are around. 

Why? Well. They‚Äôve never directly said he has autism or anything, but he is nearly 8 and if asked to ‚Äúsay you‚Äôre ‚Äòsorry‚Äô‚Äù he will literally say, ‚Äúsay you‚Äôre sorry.‚Äù 

Because he is very clearly autistic and the fact they don‚Äôt talk about it makes it very awkward for us... and others! They host annual holiday parties and other people have gossiped around their house, asking us and others if we know what the ‚Äúdeal is‚Äù with their son. We say we also don‚Äôt know.

Everyone we know or met with a child with any kind of special needs has always willingly (and often happily- if asked) explained to us every thing we need to know about their child to best interact with them. 

They don‚Äôt do this, though. We know next to nothing about their son other than he likes TV, pools, trains, and has to have someone watching him at all times.

Their son can get a little violent, cry, throw tantrums... and he‚Äôs large. I mean he‚Äôs nearly 8.

I don‚Äôt feel comfortable not knowing what could upset or aggravate him and have my ‚Äúneurotypical‚Äù 2-year-old around him, with a risk that a) she could do something that would trigger him and she could get hurt or b) she could do something that would hurt him or cause him to hurt himself.

Tonight I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore so I asked the mother straight-up about his diagnosis. 

I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore after I witnessed them ‚Äúforcing‚Äù him to eat a meal she prepared. One parent asked the other to ‚Äúforce‚Äù him to eat the food and as they did this using threats and bribery, he hated it, gagged, and the other parent said for my husband to watch out because sometimes he throws up.

I asked if forcing autistic children or children with special needs was a different approach than what I‚Äôve heard before. All I‚Äôve ever heard is that you don‚Äôt force them to try textures that make them literally gag and throw up (as what was happening at the table).

They said he was just a little asshole and also said they were tired of being short-order cooks for him... ‚Äúfood isn‚Äôt all hot dogs and PB&amp;J‚Äù and they said they learned that since he doesn‚Äôt like textures, if they force him to just try and chew it, sometimes he does like things but has to get used to the texture. 
But currently he only likes about 5 things to eat and they are sick of catering to those things and also worry about how others will judge them if they only pack those things for his lunches.

Also, earlier in the day when he misbehaved, one parent took him by the ear and threatened to hit him if he didn‚Äôt obey a command not to help himself to a food item. But he didn‚Äôt seem to actually understand the command or be able to control himself. In fact, within minutes the child was given the thing he was told he couldn‚Äôt have anyway. Within minutes. I felt like if a stern ear grab and threat of physical harm was warranted if the child didn‚Äôt listen, why give in and give them the thing they wanted anyway? 

I just didn‚Äôt understand at all what the hell is happening with their kid and it is always the elephant in the room and always awkward as hell.

The mother then told me once I asked point-blank what his diagnosis is, that he ‚Äúhas no diagnosis‚Äù and is ‚Äújust special needs‚Äù and she didn‚Äôt believe in labeling him or telling him or others that he is anything different. Because then the world treats him differently and he will see himself differently. But the kid doesn‚Äôt even seem to have a sense of self at this moment. He could and just not be able to convey it, but he seems very far away from comprehending what anyone is saying to him.

She then told me she is ‚Äúmainstreaming‚Äù him in a public school and he goes to special (very expensive) therapy on the side. I could tell she was getting very upset discussing this, so I changed the subject, explained I couldn‚Äôt understand how frustrating it must be, apologized for asking, and we moved on. 

Later once we were home, her husband texted mine and said his wife was very upset I asked about their son and that I was wrong to ask and it isn‚Äôt our business to know what is wrong with him and if they haven‚Äôt discussed it with us by now they don‚Äôt want to. It isn‚Äôt fodder for discussion and if our child was in a wheelchair and we didn‚Äôt explain, they wouldn‚Äôt ask. 

I texted him directly deeply apologizing, and explaining I thought maybe they were waiting for us to broach the subject and maybe feel relieved to discuss it with us, considering how close we are as friends in so many other ways. I also said I didn‚Äôt think their child‚Äôs special needs were equivalent to being in a wheelchair, but even if our child were in a wheelchair, we would willingly tell them why she was so they could know and interact with her in a meaningful way.

Now I just feel like such an asshole based on how they responded, but I also feel deeply disturbed by how they treat their son. As a baby from 1-4 they plopped him in front of iPads and TVs to babysit him all the time, and I already didn‚Äôt like that at all but chalked it up to me not being a parent and not knowing what that is like. Now that I am a parent, I still don‚Äôt like it, but to each their own!

I already have felt disturbed by the way they treat him with punishments as well and disparage him with name-calling when he‚Äôs within earshot... and thus have distanced myself from seeing them at all in general. I personally see them maybe three times a year. Due to this, I really don‚Äôt care about them anymore or what they think of me. But my husband likes the other husband a lot.

My husband sees the other husband many times a year. Monthly even.

This was another thing that was brought up in texts by the husband- nobody else asks about their son, including my own husband. 

I just wanted to scream... yeah, not to your face! I just asked what everyone else wants to know! Literally everyone is wondering why the heck this is some weird secret.

Why hide something socially accepted (at this time) when so many others embrace it and use it to help educate others. My own husband doesn‚Äôt know what autism ‚Äúlooks like‚Äù and I had to explain it doesn‚Äôt look like anything necessarily and send him links so he understood what is going on with his friend‚Äôs kid.

Why not tell us if we are so close? 

One thing the wife said is that the kid‚Äôs issues are their everyday-all-day life and so she doesn‚Äôt like to talk about it when socializing. I can understand that, but also, it is very awkward and weird for others when you invite them out or to your home and your 6 or 7 year old poops their pants and doesn‚Äôt speak and you‚Äôre supposed to act like it‚Äôs normal and laugh about it with them. It isn‚Äôt normal. 

Am I totally the asshole for finally asking about it now that I have a child of my own? Now that I‚Äôve met many other parents with autistic children and see how they manage their children with such love, understanding, care, and awareness to others? Now that I also want to protect their son and my daughter during their inevitable interactions in the future? How do I explain him to her? What if she asks the direct, pointed questions about him? It is literally keeping me up at night right now. 

As I said; I personally don‚Äôt care much for the couple, but my husband does and we do see them on holidays and other random events and I don‚Äôt know what to do or say to them other than what I did- apologize and say I won‚Äôt bring it up again and we can continue the way we have for the past 8 years. (Ignoring the elephant in the room.)

But am I completely wrong here? I know I chose the wrong forum to ask but I never see them so I felt like it was my only chance before my daughter is old enough to ask me questions about why their son behaves the way he does or for her to do something that might upset him. Just tonight she asked to watch her favorite movie and he cried, bawled about it until his mom turned it off my daughter‚Äôs movie and onto one he wanted to watch. My kid was a little upset by the change and said the name of her favorite movie a few times, clearly upset it was turned off, but got sucked into the other movie soon after. I can see these situations escalating in the future so I wanted some more information so I know how I can better parent my own child when around theirs.

My horrible primary school experience,"The teacher always thought of me as a problem child. I was almost never allowed in class, they said I wouldn‚Äôt understand it anyways. I was playing games from 8.30am to 2.00pm. 

When the final test came, I failed pretty bad. The teachers said I would have to go to a special school for people with an extreme low IQ. 

Thankfully my mom stepped in and said something about. My mom got me into a ‚Äònormal‚Äô high school, the school was all about the farmers life. We had lots of animals and gardening lessons. I learned a lot from that school. I started at BS LWOO (Dutch) which is the lowest level on ‚Äònormal‚Äô high schools. I climbed up 2 levels in 1,5 year. That means I went from the lowest level on this school to the highest in less then two years.

In my last year of high school they figured out I have ADD, OCD and autism. I went back to my primary school for an internship. I talked to an old teacher of mine, and spoke to her about my diagnosis.

Autistic rant about stimming cw: mention of blood and scab picking harm to self,Need some validation family sucks so just in case you don't know and you're in this feed trying to get information about Autistic people. If an Autistic person is stimming to try to not have a meltdown don't tell the Autistic person to stop. We don't do it to bother you or to embrass you usually  we are just trying to not be overwhelmed with sensory input because there are to many things going on either internally or externally and or we are trying to give ourselves more sensory input because we don't have enough and it's usually not even something we notice ourselves doing it's a habit and a coping mechanism and shouldn't be seen as bad or embrassing  are stims are a way to express ourselves when we are overwhelmed rather it be by emotions sounds lights movement etc the only time you should say something is if the Autistic person is a harm to themselves or others. And I don't mean poor aunt susan doesn't like the clicking noise I make or doesn't like how my foot bounces.

I think there should be a law to forbid neurotypical people to write autistic characters without any autistic input,"This is just an opinion, not a hate speech.

But I've seen many misguided or flat-out *wrong* portrayals of autism written by neurotypical people who themselves admit that they didn't ask any actually autistic people for guidance. The same tropes apply to *all* of these portrayals:

The character acts nothing like their age, acting like a 4-6 year old despite being in their mid-teens/early adulthood. They are rude, intrusive and don't care about other people's feelings, their lack of social awareness leads them into uncomfortable situations, which is portrayed as funny or pitiful instead of relateable. If they don't focus on the flaws, they pretend that autistic people are unrealistically ""perfect"", capable of doing things no other human being can, which is true to only a small percentage of autistic people and an impossible standard to meet for most.

I don't see myself that way. I see my flaws, but I have enough self-awareness to know that they don't really define me. I wish that society could treat autistic people like people instead of useless burdens or unrealistic geniuses.

While both portrayals were definitely well-intentioned, I think both did *way* more harm than good.",autism,1577361246,ReasyRandom,23,1,True,2019-12-26

[Rant/Asking Advice] Something happened to me a while back. It honestly felt like some kind of psychotic break from far too much pressure from far too many directions.,"I ended up crawling into our stand up shower and just screaming, but not making any sound, and just crying. My emotions drifting in and out from completely destroyed to ""nah, I'm fine"". After that, I just didn't care anymore. 

After hundreds of other very stressful situations, i warned my wife that I just needed some time to relax and unwind. I needed my space back. Every weekend she was now babysitting a friends kids. I wasn't able to sleep with them there. I was trying to be supportive, she should be able to have whatever friends she wants, but now it was becoming apparent to even me that my wife was being used. After several weekends of surprise babysitting days, and money issues coming in, my wife kept moving my stuff so she could clean and make sure the house was ""impress ready"". I hate when people touch my things, and i kept acting like it didn't matter but each time it happened it would eat me a little bit more. Someone at work keeps poking me, and I freaked out in her about it, and she acted like a wounded animal after. I had told her 20+ times in a very serious tone that I hated being touched without warning before that though. I am very straight forward with people and people keep pushing the boundaries and what I am comfortable with. I started lashing out like this in so many areas if my life, and my wife kept asking me what was wrong. I honestly didn't know. I couldn't put my finger on it, but I thought it may be that I don't get the time I need to myself anymore, or that I my space didn't matter anymore, that absolutely nothing was just mine anymore. It's always her, or the kids during the time that I would normally get to myself. I told her that my routine was being messed wirh too much and eventually she said that it's not her fault, so I just needed to suck it up. It got to the point where I started begging, and i warned her I didn't have much left in me, and she said I could have that weekend to myself. I was so excited. On my way home from work she texted me to let me know that her friend had dropped the kids off again, and my wife had known for 3 hours. Something in my just switched. I got home and my wife could see it in my face I guess. I went upstairs and she told me that I was scaring her. She asked if I was mad, and I told her no. I got into our walk in shower with my cloths on, phone still in my pocket, water on, and I asked her to leave. After some protest she did, and I just let go. After this, I couldn't bring myself to do anything I enjoyed amymore. I just slept. The girls stopped coming over, but I didn't care anymore. My wife kept getting more and more worried and started asking if I was going to kill myself. I told her no, but she didn't believe me. I honestly didn't care enough to do anything like that. That is what started to scare me though. A few weeks later I was put into a life threatening situation and I got excited, and that is what forced my hand to go see a psychiatrist. I shouldn't have waited that long. After 3 visits she determined that she strongly believes I have Autism. She gave me a book to read, and I hated reading it. So I bought an audiobook of it to listen too. Everything in mylife never made so much sense as it did after that book. It made it so much worse. I started to realize how horrible my life actually had been, and how if my mom had actually cared more, someone should have seen this ages ago. My doctor called my situation a meltdown. She asked if I had ever had meltdowns like this before, and I said never this bad. Honestly I'm scared to. The first thing I have cared about since the shower. I usually always had at least 1 thing that I was obsessed over. Minecraft is my new one. I always made fun of it, but there was actually a lot more to it than I thought. After hundreds of hours playing it, I find myself still thinking about it, and wanting to play it, but I don't. I want to go to sleep or play with my phone instead. This actually upsets me as well, i just want to enjoy it again.¬†

I haven't gone back to my doctor yet. I missed my last appt and my wife made another, but it's in Jan. How long does this last? I want to be happy, I want to enjoy my stuff again, I want to care again. It seems like it's right there, but everytime I reach for it it just gets worse. I have always thought way differently than everyone I have known, and there was so much I never understood, and everytime I try to talk about this with anyone it just becomes about them trying to relate, or how it doesn't seem like I'm autistic, or about how everyone else has the same problems. It honestly seems to have just alienated me even more. What am I supposed to do from here. I will be going back to the doctor, and she seems to be the only one in my life that actually understands, but I feel like I have changed so much since I found out about my Autism as well. I have been faking for so long, that I didn't even realize that I was even doing it anymore. I can't do it anymore though. My mind won't let me go back to where I was. Where should I go from here? How can I get my love for whatever I was obsessing over back? I want to make my wife happy, but I want to enjoy it with her as well. Has anyone else gone through thus before? How did you find your way back? Did you ever?

Disclosing our child‚Äôs diagnosis with family. Is my email okay?,"Hello everyone. 

Our little one, who is two, was diagnosed with autism a few months ago. It was hard and sad, but we love him so much and couldn‚Äôt be prouder of him. Thankfully, prior to the diagnosis, he was already receiving intervention and has been in speech and OT since 18 months. He has come such a long way. When he got diagnosed a few months ago, we weren‚Äôt ready to tell anyone, as it was still so fresh. We (me specifically) are almost ready to share now. I‚Äôve had an email drafted for awhile and wanted to hear what you all think of it. We have some judgmental people in our family (in laws) and some ‚Äúknow it alls‚Äù (my MIL. She is the one who makes me the most anxious regarding this, because she works as a TA with special needs children. In the past, she has criticized our parenting and has told us she knows more about kids because she works with them, has raised to of her own, and knows better for our children. We don‚Äôt have have a good relationship with her because of this. She also hasn‚Äôt seen us in over a year because of some hurtful and horrible things she‚Äôs said and done. I have a few things in my email that I say, that are more so indirectly towards her.) 

Anyway, here is the email that I would be sending. What do you guys think? 

 ‚ÄúHello all, 

We‚Äôve had some news that we‚Äôve been wanting to share, but weren‚Äôt ready to just yet. A few months ago, little one was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder. This was a very powerful moment in our life. His diagnosis was very hard to hear, because no one wants their child to have something that hinders their ability to learn. 

As hard as it is, we look at the diagnosis as a positive thing, because it‚Äôs helped us understand how he learns best and gets him the help he needs, from such an early age. The earlier the intervention, the better. A diagnosis is not a label but a way of understanding the truth. There is nothing to be ashamed of.

We are not looking for any advice, or opinions on this. We have a wonderful team behind us, that has been working with us for a long time, helping little one blossom into the bright little boy he has always been. He has come so far, has met so many goals, and continues to surprise us everyday. We couldn‚Äôt be more thankful and happier. 

We‚Äôd also like to share a few things about ASD, in case anyone is unfamiliar. 

So, what exactly is Autism Spectrum Disorder? 

ASD is complex developmental disability; signs typically appear during early childhood and affect a child‚Äôs ability to communicate, and interact with others. ASD is defined by a certain set of behaviors and is a ‚Äúspectrum condition‚Äù that affects individuals differently and to varying degrees.

Children with autism have symptoms or difficulty in three areas:

1. Social interaction
2. Language as used for social communication
3. Repetitive interests or behaviors

What does a child with autism look like? 

It seems like a strange question. But I know that there have been times when a person has met our son and then makes a comment such as, ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt seem like he has autism.‚Äù, ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt look like he has autism.‚Äù or ‚ÄúHe must be high functioning.‚Äù The interesting thing is that there is no ‚Äúlook‚Äù to autism. Yes, some kids may have similar behavioral or social characteristics, but they are all very different. So, this is why if someone tells us they have experience in autism, that doesn‚Äôt mean they will know or understand our child. If you do know, watch, or teach another child with autism, it is best not to compare what you know to the child you are meeting. 

Confidentiality is also especially important to parents who have chosen not to disclose their child‚Äôs diagnosis to others. While it seems like common sense not to gossip, it is worth mentioning that if we tell you something, please keep it in confidence unless you have our permission to share this information with others.

Sharing this and talking about it is still very hard for us and we ask that you please keep that in mind. If you have any questions regarding autism, I would be happy to share an answer, to the best of my abilities. 

Love, 

x and x.‚Äù",autism,1577416933,cherryx_,10,1,True,2019-12-26

Before i get into things, i'll say that the upcoming things are in a very negative tone; i don't really care if it's offensive to anyone, i've never really left the trait of a lack of empathy.

I've usually been the kind of person that is very opinionated yet somewhat interested in this topic -- i've been in schools with autistic people nearly my entire life, and despite autism being in a category of the weird kinds of people that exist, yet after all these years i've come to the point where i can usually tell if someone has autism just by looking at them (even just their face)

Do i hate autistic people for having autism? Absolutely not, however i do stay more away from them than i would with ""normal"" people; when i have enough time, i will observate them for a while until i decided whether i want to interact with them or not, while i'd usually just interact with someone that doesn't have autism immediately.

You can be whatever, gay, black, from a religion, whatever, i'll respond the same way i would with neurological people; the reason autism is a kicker for me is because its behavioral, i need time to know wether they can handle topics like this, if they won't go bonkers about anything silly, and can just behave well enough for my standards.

You'll probably respond to that with *""well they can't help it""*, i don't know if it just happens to be the circumstances i have been in but i used to be severely autistic as a child and have learned to behave normal enough for people not to even bat an eye at what i do through being bullied, yes, that thing pretty much every other autist i know talks about like it was undeserved.

Like reading a book or experiencing things, don't ignore or agree with everything they say -- the things they say should be giving you ideas, you don't have to sheepishly follow what they want you to do, but don't deflect everything they tell you either. Pick out what you think makes sense.

Sure if they make fun of things you can't change (like your appearance) its whatever, but if i can learn from what they said about me and actually end up with a thicker skin and have better social connections, why can't others? Is there something i don't know or understand, something i don't mentally have that they do?

Something that is often said is *""i'm being laughed at for being different""* which i find to be a misunderstanding, to this day i'm still a bit of an outcast with just a small group of friends and many people i can get along with decently; of course there will always be people who hate you (you can never please everyone), but i think shame is an important part of just being human, but from what i've experienced, most autists either don't have it or they just refuse to believe that what they did is wrong or dumb. Being stubborn is fine, just as long as there's at least a possibility of change or just don't throw a huge fit.

I'm not saying you have to look for approval from society itself (yes is really used that word), you can like and do whatever you want, however when you're in public, just don't be surprised if people look at you funny in circumstances of you doing something weird and get angry at them for it.

Does that mean i pretend to be someone i'm not? I don't think so, what im saying is that i've learned to change without getting rid of my likings, i've just simply learned to roll with the punches, take advantage of bad things that happened in my life, basically, just grown out of being who i used to be yet still enjoy some things i've always enjoyed, in a way that it doesn't bother anyone i care about.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess to end this off, like i said, take anything out of this that you find interesting, that may give you ideas, you never have to agree or deflect anything here. However i won't be surprised if this post gets fucked, yes, i really have sunk to the point of expecting that from my experiences; i'm of course still open for criticism and other perspectives.",autism,1577422506,shlippus,0,1,True,2019-12-26

Taking an autistic child to a funeral?,"So here is a new one in our family with our short couple of years into autism. 

The short of it:
We have a lot of funerals going to happen soon and our son isn't exactly funeral friendly? Do we take him? 

Background:
Son is 3yr nonverbal autistic. 
Has zero understanding of language as well! So there is no ""shhh"" or ""sit down"". If we wanted him to even try to sit still we would have to give him a Kindle and play a movie (Trolls during a funeral seems inappropriate). 
But these people knew him. While their families may not they certainly have seen he is high energy and extremely hard to contain in any since of the word. There will be running, flapping, screeching, &amp; laughing. I would not stop any of it nor could I if I tried. 

So babysitter? Take him? Stop by until it's time to sit still then leave?",autism,1577429758,RedSaidWhaaa,8,1,True,2019-12-27

a poem,"hello! i wrote a poem based off of my experiences as someone on the spectrum! hope you all enjoy. 



the umbrella opened 
under it came the abstract realization
that eyes can deceive us all 
one‚Äôs eyes may dance with emotion and fire 
however all i saw was the darkness 
the darkness many say a soul is captured by 
while looking dead into the eyes of reality
into places that many can barely dream of 

the words flew like fighter jets 
soaring through my mind like the blue sky 
leaving a mark larger than any cloud can ever be 
however their anticipated date was far behind 
and now not even a fighter jet can shoot missiles so far 

but once the umbrella closed
i take off a shirt to find skin
i look unto my wrist to find veins 
and i open my mouth to simply realize 
that no umbrella can ever open wide enough

Which is the best country to raise kids on the spectrum,"Hi. I am a father of an active and happy 2.25 year old boy on the spectrum. While we are trying our best, the resources in our country are pretty limited and its extremely expensive to get good therapy as well. The society here (including our own relatives) is no yet accepting of ASD as a legitimate medical condition and any developmental or psychological disorders are looked at with condescension. I have been thinking long and hard about where can I move to permanently with family so my kid gets a good environment to grow and flourish in. I can try to move to Sweden / Denmark but I am not sure if he can learn another language in addition to the two we already speak (he is almost non verbal as yet, saying only 4-5 words as yet) or to the US  but the healthcare there is extremely expensive. I may also seek a position in Canada/Australia, but it's a long shot as yet, and significantly less likely than for the Nordics and / or the US. Germany is another option, but the language issue is even more pronounced there as compared to the Nordics. Both me and my wife are English speaking professionals with post Graduate degrees and till recently, both of us were working with prestigious MNCs  before she gave up her job to be a full time mother to look for the kid.

Son with Autism - Nightmares,"Just wondering if anybody has had similar experiences and can offer any useful advice.

My son (6) regularly has nightmares, pretty much every night. He will always come through to me and my wife and get into our bed telling us he has had one. Problem is he goes to bed worrying about having nightmares which only increases the anxiety and likelihood of him having one.

We have tried dream catchers, worry monsters etc but they don't seem to work for prolonged periods of time. Particularly as he gets older.

"Diagnosed at 41 last Thurs, Dec 19","After years of clues and hints I finally got tested and was diagnosed with ASD. I gotta say the moment I was officially told this my mood didn‚Äôt really change, if anything it just made sense of many aspects and situations in my life. So far I‚Äôve only shared this with my immediate family and my only few friends I have.

I dated a girl for over 7 years, and when I ended the relationship in 2015 she had recently graduated with a doctorate in clinical psychology the year before. The relationship was very routine, which I loved, but I wasn‚Äôt in love, if anything I was frustrated because I kept hinting at her that I didn‚Äôt feel normal, even had thoughts I might be autistic, but she kept sugar coating everything with ‚ÄúNo, you‚Äôre normal, you act like a regular person, blah blah blah...‚Äù when in fact I kept showing signs.

A year and a half later I started a new relationship with a woman who saw the signs, early in the relationship she even asked if I had Asperger‚Äôs because of my weird social quirks, what triggered the question was when I opened my notes app to pull a movie quote I had in a list (Because I always make lists.) It was a relief that someone recognized it and believed me. Sadly that perfect relationship I was in ended due to her anxiety, ADHD, and her relapsing opioid addiction in the end. All this caused her to assume things that weren‚Äôt true and question my faithfulness with her. I‚Äôve learned I don‚Äôt handle relationship confrontations very well as a result of autism.

We broke up just over 2 years ago, but if it wasn‚Äôt for her I never would have got tested. When I told my niece, who works with special needs kids including those who are autistic, earlier this year that I was going to seek testing she said she already knew I might be autistic. 

It almost feels like the girl I was with for 7 years was gaslighting me into believing I was NT when deep down I knew something was there.

I‚Äôm not really sure what the point of this rant is, I tend to go on a tangent with no purpose sometimes, I suppose maybe I just needed to share my experience? 

TLDR; got diagnosed with ASD, even though an ex who‚Äôs a clinical psychologist avoided the signs and later it took another more observing ex to notice what was going on.",autism,1577444809,ixnine,9,1,True,2019-12-27

How I Got Away with an Antisocial Christmas,"Ok so months ahead of time I my old work emails and researched the best days to book off on holiday. My goal was simply to pick the dates with the highest probability this years dinners / parties would be hosted. As you would expect, my research paid off and I was relieved to dodge the bullet of grown adults wearing christmas hats and pretending to be happy about thier ¬£5 secret santa gift.

Ofcourse the organsing NT did their best to switch my dates arounsd which led to an awkward  process of making up reasons why I didn't mind ""missing out"" on the special date. In the end a smaller team orientated meeting was scheduled later just so I wouldn't feel left out (great).

Anyway I thought by some miracle I mostly got away with having an antisocial christmas, until I found out yesterday my family are having a get together. I figured I'll just go as I always do (even though they know I don't want too). I wake up to the sounds of my family (hours in advance) having a long debates about whether to take a bus or car. I hear comments in the background that I'm not ready when I was. By the time everyone was going I was already stressed and said I will get the bus on my own.

As I'm on the bus half way to the family meet, it stops nearby a lake / park I like to sit at. At that moment I felt a bad because I know what was going to happen, I pressed the bell and got off the bus. Long story short I went to the park instead (listening to a guy with a RC speedboat annoying all the wildlife), but inspite of that I don't regret it anymore.

For years I was guilt tripped into going to various family events and that I was being difficult. I think I've finally reached a point in my life where I'm not going to participate in things I don't want to, I just sit around not talkingor contributing nothing. The only reason they want me there is because I'm family and so expect me to whether I'm enjoying myself or not.",autism,1577473034,SuperOrganizm,2,1,True,2019-12-27

"Autistic child non-social with violent tendencies, how do I get her help and keep my child safe?","My little man (2) has two older half siblings, from my SO‚Äôs previous marriage.  The eldest is a girl with autism, she is 12 and non-verbal.  She at times has severe emotional issues.  When we first got together, she was biting herself and others (severe biting) and running out in front of cars and would have hours-long screaming fits.  Her father and mother did nothing, and I guess thought it was a phase or something.  I suggested she get medical attention and referred them to a specialist I got from someone at work.  They finally made an appointment at my insistence a little over a year ago and her mood swings have improved greatly and she no longer bites and episodes are less than a few minutes now.  
The issue is, as she gets older, I am fearful this will get worse.  I am scared to have my son around just her, because she seems to lack empathy and still acts out aggressively (crushing and throwing toys, tried to stomp on the cat, hitting) when she does not get her way.  
I also will not let any one adult watch the both of them at the same time, as she is unpredictable.  At one point, we had a nanny, and Dad left them both with the nanny, against my wishes, and Daughter took off because she knew the nanny could not watch both her and the baby, and the police had to be called.  
I do believe it is due more to lack of coping mechanisms and behavior issues more so than just autism.  I know it is frustrating for her to not be able to communicate, but her parents seem content to let her spend all hours in her room on her iPad.  If forced to do anything else, she will act out.  She has taken all of her clothes off at her brothers birthday party before, as she did not want to be there and wanted to leave.  If given food she does not like, she will chew it up and spit it out at everyone.  She is not potty trained, and will pee on furniture if she is not allowed to go to her room.  She will scream at restaurants or at baseball games if not given her iPad, and if she is sent to her room, she will dig in her diaper and smear poop around her room.  We have had to get carpets cleaned, new mattresses and repaint.  
She does most of these things because they have the intended affect, she will be given her iPad and attention, and then shoved in her room.  
She is not dumb, but her parents don‚Äôt want to deal with her, and they don‚Äôt work with her as far as communication or potty training.  She will be 13 soon, and I worry for both my son and her brother who is 2 years younger than her.  She is clever and strong, and as she gets older, she will continue to create issues on a larger scale I believe.  
I do feel for her, and I have been the best advocate that I can for her wellbeing, but her parents seem uninterested or resentful at any suggestions I make.  I think attention and coping tactics and potty training would make a huge difference for her, unfortunately they are not interested in taking the time to do this for her.  
I have tried to work with her, but I have a full time job and a child of my own.  I also can‚Äôt get her dad to be consistent, and her mother, who has her e/o week, doesn‚Äôt try at all.  
Her father and I are at a crossroads, and may be separating, in a large part to he and his ex‚Äôs unwillingness to parent her.  I am torn however, because I don‚Äôt know what I can do for her and her brother going forward.  I also want to protect my son in the event of future custody arrangements, I don‚Äôt feel that it‚Äôs safe for him.  
I do care for her, but as she gets older, I am seeing less and less human response from her (I‚Äôm sorry, I don‚Äôt know how else to say it) and I know at a certain point, if they do not change and work with her more, I do see her violent and disruptive tendencies increasing.  She does not show or express love, she watches demented violent cartoons and laughs (another thing I had to intervene with her parents with) and hates everything but smiles when others are crying or upset.  
I want to protect her, but ultimately I need to protect my son.  Her parents bathe her, feed her, take her to school, and shove an iPad in her face the rest of the time, so she is not in any direct danger, but I can‚Äôt live like this, both for my son and the frustration that they don‚Äôt do more for her.  They make too much for home health care assistance, but too little to be able to afford to pay for it.  What can I do?",autism,1577478240,ohyougotpoopcorn,5,1,True,2019-12-27

I honestly just don‚Äôt know how to make friends.,"I‚Äôm 17 years old, I moved to Canada some 5 years ago after my parents divorced and throughout high school I was super lonely and made no friends. I just finished my first semester of university, and I am doing well academically and enjoy my subjects. Despite this I still have no actual friends. I have a bunch of acquatances, as I‚Äôm not antisocial or have social anxiety or anything. I talk to people who sit next to me and stuff. 

I kinda made a couple people who are sorta more than acquatances. One of them a guy I sat next to, whom I shared a bunch of interests and studied for exams with. We‚Äôve kinda lost contact with each other after the semester though.

Another is a girl who sat next to me in history class whom I also shared a lot of interests with but I kinda screwed that up when I tried to date her, as it was the only way I really know how to progess relationships. We did get along well though, and shes pretty shy herself, though has a few close friends. Afterwards we agreed to be friends, and I believed her when she said that. We are friends on snapchat and we read each others stories (I recently started trying to use social media to try keep in touch with people without directly texting them), however she gives a lot of mixed signals like sometimes just not replying to my texts so I dunno if that will ever work out in terms of being friends. We both like the Lord of the Rings, and I honestly just wanted to watch that with her, (in a platonic matter) but something so simple seems so distant and difficult. I‚Äôd like to text her more often as I often have comments to make or things to say but I don‚Äôt because I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm just being annoying. I honestly can‚Äôt tell if she actually does not like me, or i‚Äôm just overthinking. 

I guess I have to try again because I‚Äôve been told friendship is a numbers game. I‚Äôm seeing counselling now but my first session seemed very unhelpful and like we did not really understand each other. Even if that does help I‚Äôm not sure what to do in the mean time. Constantly putting in so much effort into relationships after finally meeting someone I connect with (which is rare in itself) is so tiring. I cannot keep doing this if I get the same results every time. Relationships apparently take time to build, but I have not had one last longer than a year since primary school. What should I do? Where do I meet people? My counsellor tells me to diversify and look for friends outside of school but I honestly don‚Äôt know where? I have hobbies but none of them really get me out to meet people, and I don‚Äôt really know of any social hobbies I‚Äôd be interested in. I feel like I even struggle to relate to other lonely people, because it seems they are usually do socially anxious or depressed to  go out and meet people.

Does this sound like high functioning Autism?,"I‚Äôve always wondered, because I‚Äôve exhibited a lot of the symptoms/signs. I developed speech issues very young, around 2 and 3 years old. I was never non-verbal, but did manage to develop a speech impediment. My other siblings also had difficulties with speech. 

But, also from a young age I would always talk to myself, have trouble reading emotions in people, and would have very possessive interest. Meaning that if something caught my eye and I liked it, I would pursue it and do everything to know about it and research it. I developed an interest in things such as planes, ships, films like Star Wars, and history periods like World War II by the time I was 6. I would obsess over the subjects, making them the topic of my conversations with most people when I was a kid. While I saw that others didn‚Äôt have the same affinity for these things as I did, and I always felt attacked when they disregarded or I overheard how they talked about how it would be the only things I would talk about.


Talking to myself was to put myself at ease, and try and concentrate my thoughts better, and ease my anxiety. But, growing up, and after talking to a psychologist in the past year it‚Äôs been determined that I have OCD, something I expected for years. Never mentioned any of these details to them, which I should have. Might have actually got the answer to this question. 

Talking to myself would also often result in meltdowns, I did everything to hide them from family. Most of what I consider bad ones would be in a place of solitude like my bathroom where I knew no one would try and look for me. Other times, lesser meltdowns were in front of my family, and often resulted in them being regarded as tantrums. I was a very emotional child, and still am as an adult, though I‚Äôve learned to control it better. Though reading other people and their emotions were always difficult. Unless it was anger, I could read that easily. 

During my teenage years, I managed to reduce the amount that I would talk about things I had an interest over. But, I was very anti-social and still had difficulties just talking to people. It was around middle-school that with puberty and everything else, my speech impediment went away and I could actually talk better. Meltdowns actually got worse during these years though, even though I managed to control them better. 

I also had sensory issues, were if anyone touched me or tried to touch me without me initiating I would freeze, or feel overstimulated. Someone touching me on the shoulder would cause me to freeze up. This has since passed now, but in erogenous areas I still feel over stimulated. 

I use to have difficulty holding conversations or maintaining eye contact. But, that has changed over time. I find social engagements easier. But, people still tell me they notice differences in me when I speak compared to other people. One being that I am extremely blunt. Or, that the topics I pick seem a little strange.

I understand sarcasm around people I‚Äôm comfortable with, and use it pretty often myself. However, if I have known someone for only a few months, even after multiple conversations with the person, I can‚Äôt always tell when they‚Äôre joking or not. I am also able to pick up on lying pretty easily. But, I also expect that a lot of what people say to me are lies.

I can go on, but these are some of the things I‚Äôve noticed over the years",autism,1577492735,Razgriz_21,3,1,True,2019-12-27
"Late diagnosed friends, did you ""get worse"" when you found out you might be autistic?","What i mean by getting worse is, did you start noticing your sensory difficulties more intensely?

Advice Wanted: Does my boss have autism?,"Posting here to ask for advice. I hope this doesn‚Äôt offend anyone because I realize autism exists on a spectrum, but I would like some insight on if it‚Äôs a possibility on why he behaves the way he does.

My boss is a highly intelligent doctor, but socially he comes across as either hot and cold, or cold and distant. He has one autistic child which raises my suspicion that he could also be autistic.

He‚Äôs always very terse and abrupt. He‚Äôll greet me ‚Äúhi‚Äù and ‚Äúbye‚Äù, but never engages in regular small talk like ‚Äúhow was your weekend‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat‚Äôd you have for lunch‚Äù? There are many people he doesn‚Äôt even greet when he walks past. I know there‚Äôs a stereotype of doctors being a-holes, but he‚Äôs always quite calm and never lashed out at anyone so I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs it.

His emails are usually short, like few word responses but sometimes he doesn‚Äôt respond at all (which annoys a lot of people). He also seems to lack common courtesy... like he doesn‚Äôt tell us when he‚Äôll be absent, give us basic feedback, or inform us of offices events/when to leave early etc. 
Many of us are bothered that he‚Äôs so disengaged from us!

Is there any way to determine if he‚Äôs autistic without asking? I really want to understand him better to know if it‚Äôs a problem with us (the employees) or if that‚Äôs just the way he is. Thanks!",autism,1577502437,secretspareaccount,0,1,True,2019-12-27

Bad Therapist,"I'm currently going through this subreddit to understand autism a bit more to be a better ally, but I thought I'd might as well share this story since it's related. 

I'm not on the spectrum, or at least I don't think I am. But I've always had bad social anxiety as a kid, speech issues, along with adhd. Therefore I lack in some social queues and have occasional sensory overloads (sound mostly).

But when I was about a freshman in high school I was forced to go to therapy for self injury. Forced as in, I didn't want to, at all. The first thing the therapist basically said was ""well I don't want to send you away from home..."" and did other things like tell me that my social anxiety makes me seem like a dick to other people since I don't talk. 

I was forced to keep seeing this therapist because everyone thought I wouldn't be good with any therapist, since I didn't want to be there in the first place. So all I did was point out things I didn't like about them, all the time, every other second. Before pretending like I was oblivious to this at all and that I'm ""just blunt"" (part of this is still true, I simply notice more things I don't like and say them if you get on my nerves)

What finally got my parents convinced that I should no longer see her was the fact that she tried to diagnose me with aspergers. Her evidence to my mom was basically ""he has trouble socializing and stims"" (the trouble socializing basically as ""your kid keeps fucking insulting me and I'm trying to explain to him to stop yet he keeps going"")

Soon after that I got a new therapist which I didn't like any better and did the same thing with, but that one didn't reach the conclusion that I must be on the spectrum. In fact I've had 3 psychiatrists and 2 other therapists that were surprised when I even brought this specific story up.",autism,1577506833,sleeping-satan,1,1,True,2019-12-27
Favorite Person,"How many of you have a favorite person? It's not like a best friend, it's comparable to having a special interest, except that interest is a person. Not a celebrity, but a real person that you talk to regularly. This person becomes in charge of your loneliness and your happiness, and just seeing their name can make you flutter with happiness.

How do you deal with knowing that it puts a lot of pressure on them to be your everything, even if they don't know they mean that much to you? How do you deal with feeling guilty for wanting their time? How do you deal with crushing disappointment that they don't want to do something you love doing, ever? How do you deal with knowing the actual rational thought, but not being able to stop the hurt feelings from coming because your favorite person doesn't want to do something with you, or doesn't have time for you right now because they're busy, or any other number of extremely normal things that means they're around less?

How do you remove them from the idea of a favorite person, so that you don't have to feel guilty for liking them so much?

Sorry that this is sort of a cross between a vent post, but my only friend is also my best friend and my favorite person, and I feel so guilty every time I want some of his time, and hurt whenever he doesn't want to do something with me, and I hate feeling that way, and I just want to know if there are methods of getting over it that anyone's figured out. I hate feeling like this. I hate knowing things logically but my chest still wants to be tight and hurty.

Autistic play. It's not as bad as many neurotypicals think.,"Autistics often play differently than neurotypicals. We often line things up or stack things rather than use them in ways that a neurotypical would. One might turn a toy truck or car over spin the wheels on or look it over in very fine detail. Autistic play is not wrong play. It is often play that teaches them things that most neurotypical children won't learn till later in life &amp; in some cases if at all. A child turning over a toy truck, car or construction vehicle may have intense interest in mechanical objects &amp; how they work. That was the case for me. When I took the mechanical comprehension test for military in high school I was one of the top scorers in the country. Unfortunately my Dispraxia &amp; autism got in the way of being able to perform in that industry.

Jacob Barnett observed how light bounced as a young child. He also like counting things then &amp; observing the space needed to contain said number of objects. Now at 19 years old he is going for his PhD in physics &amp; has studied light propagation through different materials. Additionally he has surpassed his instructors in math &amp; it's application to the real world physics. He also has a disability that prevent him from being able to tie his shoes. That didn't stop him from becoming one of the great mathematicians in the world. 

His mother focused on what interested him instead of demanding he learn something he just couldn't get. Once she did that he blossomed emmensely. His early therapists did just the opposite &amp; he ended up shutting down until his mother said enough.

Parents please don't stop children from playing in the way that best suits their learning style, especially neurodiverse children as that may be their ticket to learning something that could in fact change the world in a positive way.",autism,1577528087,germanium21,60,1,True,2019-12-28

The job i love is making me depressed,"Hey all,

I unfortunately don't know the best title for this thread, However i have found myself in a very annoying situation and i would love to get your opinions on what to do.

Bassically for the past 6 months i have had the job of a customer service agent for a major international airline down in australia. In short my job bassically involves checking in guests, performing initial security checks for overseas guests, boarding planes, marshalling flights and working in the airline lounge.

Now let me just say i love my job, the aviation industry is my special interest and the fact that i am interacting with planes on an almost daily basis, and playing a mjaor role in the overall operation of the industry for an airline i love is incredible. i am blessed that i was able to acheive this role and in general everyone has been very supportive and understanding and i love the people i work with.

However the problem lies in the fact that as the job title states my role is incredibly customer orientated, and due to the nature of it, i am required to mask my true personality very significantly for extended periods of time, i am normally an individual who cant go to the shops without noise cancelling headphones due to auditory overload, i stutter significantly whenever talking to starangers and i stim alot as a way to remain calm and avoid having a meltdown. But with this job i need to hide all of that while keeping a calm composure in order to perform my role. 

This has led to me becoming exhausted 24/7 due to the sheer fact that i use so much energy just trying to perform my job that i dont have anymore outside of work. This exhaustion has led to me losing interest in other hobbys like gaming (the one thing i used to disconnect from the world to calm down in times of great stress), avoiding any other social activitys i had (i didn't have many in the first place with it being mainly just me going to church once a week) and pretty much sleeping any spare time i have. This in turn has led me to have more meltdowns in recent months than the year prior and in general making me feel more depressed than i have been in a long time (bare in mind i have an official diagnosis of dpression and have been on anti depressents for a while)

Like i said earlier, i love my job and the reason why i havent just bombed out of it yet like i nornally do for jobs is because of that exact reason. I would love to keep it and progress in the industry that i love. However at the same time i would love all your advice on what to do. Because currently i am really struggling. 

Sorry if this post was a bit disjointed, not the best at opening up.

Thanks in advance all.",autism,1577541251,Bolticus13,2,1,True,2019-12-28
Autism symptoms varies greatly among identical twins,"Doing my morning reading, I found [this gem](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/severity-autism-symptoms-varies-greatly-among-identical-twins) and the [article it comes from](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10519-019-09987-2). It is an interesting piece on the heritability of autism generally and specific symptoms specifically. 

My takeaways here are 

* Autism is very, very genetic given that 96% of the time, if one identical twin is diagnosed the other will be too
* Autism is highly heritable (about 85% likelihood)
* Specific symptoms aren't genetically linked as strongly (only 9% overlap)

Given this lack of a genetic basis for specific symptoms, this suggests that siblings who both have a diagnosis have the same symptoms at a rate no better than chance. Does this fit anyone else's experiences?",autism,1577543139,MorwenInMotion,5,1,True,2019-12-28
"A misdiagnosis, or just my ignorance?","I was diagnosed with autism when I was seven, but only because I had a few little obsessions and ""struggle to communicate"". I'm not over-sensitive to anything except for the sound of people eating, I know what to say in social situations and I can read facial expressions really easily. However, my entire family and school thinks that I am truly autistic. But the thing is, I don't think I am. I have taken a lot of autism tests and they have all said that I don't have autism.

However, whenever something bad happens and makes me upset, my family always links it to the autism diagnosis. They think that the reason I'm upset is because something ""different"" happened and ""changed my daily routine"". My autistic brother is OBSESSED with saying that I'm autistic. He says it too often. For example, when someone uses a triggering word and I have a panic attack (from PTSD), he says ""the word doesn't even mean anything. She's so autistic."" He also says that I'm autistic just because I like to walk as an exercise.

When I try to explain that I don't think I'm autistic, I always get the same replies: ""Yes, you are."" ""Just accept it."" ""You've been diagnosed."" ""Why do you think it's a bad thing?"" 
I don't want to talk bad about my family, but they just assumed that I have something against autistic people when I don't. 

Then there's my sister. One time I said that I was ""an autism"" as a silly joke, and she kept saying it over and over again after that. Even when I told her to stop, she kept saying it. Also, there was a boy at my old school who hated me for no reason, and when someone told him that I was autistic, he wouldn't shut up about it.

I really don't know what to do. I don't know if I've been misdiagnosed, or if I really am autistic and in denial. Does anybody know what I should do?",autism,1577543186,FallenAngel960,7,1,True,2019-12-28
Dating someone with an autistic teen.,"I apologize if this is not the right sub Reddit.

I recently started dating a woman with a midteens autistic son. I'm feeling a bit lost in how to navigate parts of the relationship where her son's autism affects us.

Lately she's felt safe enough to talk about her feelings about being a mom of an autistic child. Fears for his future, feeling disappointed in herself that she did isn't doing a better job, frustration when he melts down in a public space or event that she thought the both of them could enjoy together, and guilt when she gives in to his stay-at-home-watch-youtube-all-day behavior.

I've watched her. In my opinion, she is a good mom. She has advocated for child in numerous ways and is trying to walk that line between giving him what he can handle and forcing him to experience the outside world at least a little bit.

As ""the boyfriend"" I know not to interfere or vocalize any judgments about how she and her child interact unless I'm asked for it. What I do is validate her feelings, remind her what she's doing right with specific examples, and listen without trying to fix (I'm still working on that one).

Her child is around about half the time since she coparents with her ex-husband. When the child is not around, we do things that she can't do when he is home.

With regard to the young lad, I try to act according to his mother's guidance. Don't reach out to him, let him come to me. Be very literal minded and don't try to change what he does or how he does it. I'm learning about how to interact with him around the house for small stuff like how he wants his waffles or talk about the kinds of anime he likes. But out in public, he did something that really bothered me.

We took him out to a local village that does a lot of stuff for Christmas. She thought it was a good opportunity to give the young lad a new experience and maybe he would enjoy it as well. 

Things did not go as planned. We get to the village, we have a late lunch and then he starts a melt down because he wants to go home and watch youtube. I was disturbed to see him shoving his mom when she did not comply with his demands. His mom started getting angry but took a step back to cool off. The young lad turned to me and started pushing me and demanding I take them home.  

I chose the path of non-engagement. I told him that hitting was not acceptable, waited a bit in silence then redirected all of us to a nearby event. I did things like offering him some candy without judgement or condition, and walking through the village by saying this is where we are going and expecting him to follow.

I feel like he as learned that if he bullies or acts out he will get what he wants which is to go home where he can watch youtube. You can't punish someone by taking them away from somewhere they don't want to be anyway.

These questions are weak but I have walked into a huge new world and I'm trying to get my bearings. 

Is there's anything else I could do to support someone who is also a parent of a teenaged autistic male child.

Should/could I have handled the young lad's melt down differently? To be frank, I acted like I was training a stubborn dog or a programming team. Deescalate conflict, make expected behavior clear and act as if it will be given, don't punish, and reward good behavior.

How much of his sullen, acting as if you don't exist, hiding in youtube/room is autism vrs normal teenage behavior?  My teen years are no guide as I had an early onset mood disorder on top of the hormones. I want to be kinder to a teen with challenges than my parents were to me.

I know I need to stay on the sidelines and not interfere but I also need to learn more.

How do you recover after having a meltdown in front of family/ significant others?,"I was misdiagnosed over 10 years ago with Borderline Personality. Earlier this year, my therapist said I wasnt, and later diagnosed me with Autism Spectrum. My family is fairly used to my ""meltdowns"" which usually involve a lot of yelling and screaming on my behalf. My parents have accepted my ASD diagnosis, but I dont think my boyfriend (we have been together 6 years) truly believes me, or rather just thinks this is my ""personality"" or a ""trait"". 
Long story short, he spent the night, and this morning we were going to hangout and find something to do. The weather was horrible outside, with freezing rain, and even a weather warning to not drive unless *absolutely* necessary. I said I didnt want to go anywhere else today because driving or even being in the car was giving me anxiety just thinking about it.
He was fine with this, but then didnt bother helping me figure out what to do with our day. This lead to him pushing my buttons, and i kept telling him to leave me alone for a moment because i was getting stressed. This kept going on and I fully had a meltdown screaming and now I feel like a pariah in front of my family.

Thus I feel left in a situation where either she didn't give me the support I could have gotten all my life or she is lying to try and manipulate me (I believe based on my moms history of behaviour she may have a personality disorder).

She has literally told police officers (Mom called the police because she didn't like a Facebook post calling out her abuse), other government officials and the whole of Facebook I'm autistic and 'vulnerable' without a diagnosis.

Is the song 'Spasticus Autisticus' offensive?,"I had an uncomfortable experience Christmas day at the family home of my boyfriends best friend, the best friend was playing funny videos on YouTube he went to play 'Spasticus Autisticus' by Ian Dury and The Blockheads.

The title is supposed to be provocative so I was instantly uncomfortable, which my boyfriends friend picked up on (to be honest I was a little stoned so the reaction may have been less subtle than intended) and my boyfriend also had a very strong reaction against it as he clearly thought it was inappropriate given as I'm Autistic. 

The best friend didn't play it, the mood had radically changed - I don't know if my boyfriend may have indicated it wasn't okay or something.

My understanding is the song was written as a protest against patronising disabled charities, and the guy who wrote it was disabled himself. BUT I'm not sure whether Ian Dury was Autistic, the title sounds offensive and although punk is provocative I still found it insensitive for this to be played by an NT with an Autistic present.

12yo son refuses to come out of his room -- what do I do?!,"Hi, everyone ... an online friend recently told me about this forum and I'm hoping I could please get some advice from adults with autism and maybe other parents of kids with autism.  


My eldest is 12. He's very verbal, very bright, but struggles behaviorally, particularly at school. He can be incredibly sweet but also very irritable and angry at small things. He had been doing pretty well at home, even with his 8yo sister (who is generally the bane of his existence, although she's just a typical little girl), but lately he doesn't want anything other than to stay in his room all day. Not even reading, or playing games on his iPad, which I would be fine with, as I was a kid who stayed in my room and read most of my childhood. He just wants to lay in bed under his covers. (And no, I don't think it's what you're thinking -- he shows ZERO signs of puberty yet.)  


I indulged this for a while and thought it was a phase but now I fear it's self-reinforcing. He barely wants to come out at mealtimes. He doesn't want me to come in and talk to him or do anything with him. He just tells me he ""wants to be left alone right now."" I have begged. He just shouts at me and tells me to go away. I have told him he can pick any activity he wants -- choose a favorite game? Watch a favorite TV show? Play his brother's new Nintendo Switch? He doesn't care. He just tells me to go away and leave him alone. He spent all of Christmas Day in his room, even though the only guests we had were my parents and my aunt.   


He says he's not in pain. Nothing is bothering him that he has articulated. No recent changes in circumstances either. I'm at the end of my rope, and I don't know if I should let him just be alone and brood or try to enforce at least a small amount of time with the rest of us every day.",autism,1577576636,LolliaSabina,15,1,True,2019-12-28
"Potentially Unpopular Thought: Yes, I think I am genuinely mildly autistic. I feel slightly guilty about feeling this way, given the discourse surrounding functioning labels.","I know that a lot of the community hates functioning labels and I understand why. They are crude. They are used to dismiss people‚Äôs needs, as well as underestimate abilities. I am not a huge fan of them either, but I just can‚Äôt shake feeling like I fall very far on one very extreme end of all of this and have my entire life. My close family members would likely agree and my parents describe me as having been rather precocious as a little kid.

My family didn‚Äôt begin to seek professional help for me until I was a tween, when they began to really suspect that something was different, and even then, it took years for me to get a diagnosis. It took me a while to even have any self-awareness about most of my traits. I have heard about and read the sentiment that us ‚Äúhigh functioning/level one/sperg‚Äù folk shield the outside from a hell of inner turmoil and incredibly hard masking work to make the presentation more subtle, but I just don‚Äôt see that in myself. I feel like my symptoms are pretty mild for me too in an internal sense and don‚Äôt affect much, unless there is something I am missing or have yet to become aware of‚ÄîI seem to have low support needs both inside and out.

I am not trying to brag. I actually tend to feel a tad insecure and a sort of ‚Äúreverse‚Äù impostor syndrome around this topic.

What I should do to help my brother‚Äôs future?,"Hello reddit. 

I don‚Äôt know if this is the best place to ask this but I‚Äôve been anxious about the new year.  The reason is it‚Äôs another year where my mom and brother get older.  If you think there is a better website or reddit to ask for advice on this, please let me know.

For some context,  My brother is non-verbal and requires care 24/7. Fortunately, My mom and I are able to take care of him for now, but it‚Äôs getting harder every year and I have been concerned about his future, finically and personally. 

I will take care of him as best as I can, but I don‚Äôt know what the future holds for him (or even me, since I don‚Äôt have a flexible and stable job, or my mom, who is entering her 50s and is managing everything as a single parent). 

 One person told me my brother may end up going to facility or a group home and That it will be ok for him. Another person told me that we should keep my brother away from a facility or group home as much as possible. Mom told me we may enroll him in workshops developed specifically for autistic young adults after he finishes with school.

Going into the new year, what should I do to help him out? what should I do to prepare both myself and and him? What resources should I be looking out for?

He‚Äôs my brother and I can‚Äôt sleep on this problem no matter how many times my mom tells me ‚Äòwe‚Äôll do our best with what we have‚Äô

I honestly just don‚Äôt know how to make friends.,"I‚Äôm 17 years old, I moved to Canada some 5 years ago after my parents divorced and throughout high school I was super lonely and made no friends. I just finished my first semester of university, and I am doing well academically and enjoy my subjects. Despite this I still have no actual friends. I have a bunch of acquatances, as I‚Äôm not antisocial or have social anxiety or anything. I talk to people who sit next to me and stuff. 

I kinda made a couple people who are sorta more than acquatances. One of them a guy I sat next to, whom I shared a bunch of interests and studied for exams with. We‚Äôve kinda lost contact with each other after the semester though.

Another is a girl who sat next to me in history class whom I also shared a lot of interests with but I kinda screwed that up when I tried to date her, as it was the only way I really know how to progess relationships. We did get along well though, and shes pretty shy herself, though has a few close friends. Afterwards we agreed to be friends, and I believed her when she said that. We are friends on snapchat and we read each others stories (I recently started trying to use social media to try keep in touch with people without directly texting them), however she gives a lot of mixed signals like sometimes just not replying to my texts so I dunno if that will ever work out in terms of being friends. We both like the Lord of the Rings, and I honestly just wanted to watch that with her, (in a platonic matter) but something so simple seems so distant and difficult. I‚Äôd like to text her more often as I often have comments to make or things to say but I don‚Äôt because I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm just being annoying. I honestly can‚Äôt tell if she actually does not like me, or i‚Äôm just overthinking. 

I guess I have to try again because I‚Äôve been told friendship is a numbers game. I‚Äôm seeing counselling now but my first session seemed very unhelpful and like we did not really understand each other. Even if that does help I‚Äôm not sure what to do in the mean time. Constantly putting in so much effort into relationships after finally meeting someone I connect with (which is rare in itself) is so tiring. I cannot keep doing this if I get the same results every time. Relationships apparently take time to build, but I have not had one last longer than a year since primary school. What should I do? Where do I meet people? My counsellor tells me to diversify and look for friends outside of school but I honestly don‚Äôt know where? I have hobbies but none of them really get me out to meet people, and I don‚Äôt really know of any social hobbies I‚Äôd be interested in. I feel like I even struggle to relate to other lonely people, because it seems they are usually do socially anxious or depressed to  go out and meet people. I want to do that but I don‚Äôt know where or how.",autism,1577596330,GeneralWalters421,1,1,True,2019-12-29
Special Interests,"I saw a post here maybe a day or two ago and a lot of the comments are about everyone‚Äôs special interests. I don‚Äôt expect anyone to really care, but I thought I‚Äôd share some of mine?

I‚Äôm super into linguistics. I speak lots of language fluently, and lots almost fluently. I‚Äôm super picky about grammar, and language is really easy for me. If I think about something as if it‚Äôs a language, I can understand it. I can do math that seems to be hard for other people. I used to do hard math with my dad when I was really little. We‚Äôd pull out a big sheet of paper and do really fun stuff.  I used to be super into aerospace engineering. I knew all the formulas and everything. I‚Äôm really good at programming, too (hence ‚Äòprogramming language‚Äô). I want to do game design for a company in Japan when I grow up. I love astronomy, too. I want to buy my boyfriend a binary star someday. I hope he doesn‚Äôt know I post here so he won‚Äôt see that. 

I really really like building things. I do vex robotics. But I think my team never listens to me. If they did, I think we‚Äôd be doing a lot better this season, because I have good ideas too, even though I‚Äôm autistic. I build Gundam figures when I don‚Äôt have a bigger project on my hands, but most of the time I do things like machining actuators and building cool gadgets. My current project is designing and building a similar thing to Three-Dimensional Maneuver Gear, like is seen on Attack on Titan. Of course, I‚Äôm starting small. My first goal is to be able to launch a teddy bear, and then a heavier baby doll, and so on until maybe we get to launching humans. 

I really really like weaponry. Weapons of mass destruction and smaller stuff. Everything. I really love swords, battle axes, scythes, maces, and halberds. But I‚Äôm super into all that stuff. I‚Äôve been wanting to get into metalworking for the longest time, and I sorta have, but I‚Äôm not great yet, so I‚Äôll keep working hard. I want to build myself a well-crafted scythe and a huge battle axe. Once I get there, I‚Äôll be happy with my metalworking skill. I like tanks, too, and battleships. I like trains a lot. I also like sewing. I want to do custom wedding dresses and cosplay as a side ‚Äòhustle‚Äô. I wouldn‚Äôt charge anything above what the materials cost (which are pretty cheap if you want them decent). I just want to see people happy and in well-fitting, well-made clothing. 

I think I‚Äôm really good at philosophy and psychology, or at least, it interests me. I could never do anything like social work, because I have lots and lots of trouble understand people, but like I said, I think of psychology/philosophy like it‚Äôs a language. I know how people work, but I know I don‚Äôt function the same way. My favorite psychologist is Freud. I don‚Äôt know if Schr√∂dinger counted as a philosopher or not. I also like Nikola Tesla! But he‚Äôs irrelevant here, I think. My philosophy in regards to our purpose in life is that, to be good people, we have to do two things: make others happy, and be happy ourselves. There‚Äôs more to it, but it makes sense like that in my head. 

I think the most important special interest of mine is music. I‚Äôm musically savant. I play about every instrument you could think of, aside for some traditional stuff like the erhu, although I could maybe pick it up easily. I don‚Äôt know, though. I write a lot of music. I used to ghost write for some Japanese artists, but now I‚Äôm an independent artist on Nico Nico Channel. But I do violin competitions. I once had to sight read Paganini‚Äôs caprice 24 because I misread the date of a competition. I got first place and audience‚Äôs favorite.

"My language hypothesis for HF/Asperger communications, I believe I have solved the language barrier.","Soo ill be straight up, I am experimenting on my self chemically to alter my perspectives by following research notes from EU, and 2 of my personal autism heroes who did the same and made billions of dollars hint hint. So through this experimentation I was able to temporarily create neural networks throughout the dormant portions of my brain, that are  normally inactive due to the autism..... Well I was able to see, and to understand the world as a NT.... mind shattering truly...to see what a purely logic based mind was all about, vs a mind of raw....metaphoric, emotions, primal creatures?  umm i guess just call it HF autism/aspie VS NT mind... I realized how fucking smart Aspies naturally are because of our brains wiring, (on average a 20-30point gap) between us and a NT, well Lets look at that in context  
70iq - Mentally disabled/Retarded  
70-90 Impared  
90-110 NT IQ  
Aspie 100-130 IQ

&amp;#x200B;

 any way... I had a revelation...think how hard it is to understand a fully disabled person...pretty hard, and thats not a big leap... just 20 points. So I went up to my 60 year old parents....and spoke to them like they were 12 years old, using metaphor's, cutting out any word over 2 syllables, talking as flatly as I could, and in general thinking of them as children. and surprise, surprise! the slight widening of the eyes, the comprehension marked across the forehead, the glances at each other, and the conversation carried on...

SOOOOOOOOOOO HERES THE BIG THING ONE, THE #1 REVELATION, RIGHT HERE -----&gt;  we who think in logic points...are laying out the logic points, we are laying the breadcrumbs expecting that the neurotypical will see each individual breadcrumb and be able to put them together on their own.....WRONG! THATS WHERE WE ARE WRONG! they cant see the puzzle!  its just how our brains perceive the world!  we have more in common with a schizophrenic talking to the toaster, than we do to a neurotypical in world views!

So what is the purpose for this post? well I noticed other people doing the same, talking in logic points like I was, and than not being understood by ""parent of autistic person"" AKA my experience is replicated, and algorithmicly speaking if theres one, than theres a shit ton more! so I just wanted to throw this it...my view of the entire situation.

"Problems with being social, yet very lonely","Hi, 23 yo f, got diagnosed very late (at 18 yo) with autism.

I have always struggled with making friends. Now my health has got worse, I'm not able to leave the house alone anymore (wheelchair bound, unable to walk, muscle weakness etc) and the friends that I had, are only my friends now when they feel like it (when they are bored, have no one else to meet up with etc) and it went down to 1 ''friend''.

I find it hard to meet new people, not only because of my health issues, but also because of my autism struggles. People easily scare me, because I've been taken advantage of so many times and let down a lot. Besides that, I don't have a proper way to make eye contact or be ''welcoming'' with body language, as my parents have always said. Once when someone talks to me, for example in the grocery store, I shut down. I go on ''automatic pilot'' and say what's socially accepted. Like this one time, a dude came up to me and said ''wow, I love your sweater, that's a great band!'' (was wearing a Slipknot sweater) and I thanked him for the nice compliment. I tried to make a bit of a conversation, because he was looking like a nice guy with positive intentions. I asked ''is there more music you like? I've been looking for new bands/singers to explore'' and we got in a small conversation. The next time I was in that same grocery store, I saw him again and he told his co-workers (very sensitive hearing, unfortunately...) ''oh no, she is here again. I was just being nice and she suddenly got really weird, cover me up please''. 

So, like that, many similar situations happened. I somehow are always weird, I can't make normal small talk, and whenever I meet someone who is interested in me, I'm just their backup plan for whenever they have no one else. I am obsessed with rabbits (I have two free roam rabbits myself, they're my everything) and tropical aquariums (I have a 110 liters one, love being busy with it) but when I try to talk about it, people always try to change the conversation to something else. Gossiping n such isn't something I like. I can't have easily ''funny'' or entertaining conversations, I only can focus on stuff which I'm interested in. Like asking how someone is feeling, talking about the day, helping others, about my rabbits/aquarium, hobbies of others. I love it when people are being passionate about a subject, but not when it's gossiping or being entertained by someone else's pain or whatever. 

It feels really lonely now. I do have a good relationship with my boyfriend, but it's still lonely when not having any good friends. This sends me right back into depression and being super aware of my ''abnormalities''. I have an amazing psychiatrist luckily who really supports me, but it's still hard. Right now my ''best friends'' are my doctors and psychiatrist... I don't know how to break this ongoing social problem.",autism,1577635043,spooniextubie,11,1,True,2019-12-29

Brother feels useless,"My brother has autism and he feels he's just a burden on us. I love him and have never considered him a burden. My mom and I have a split custody deal going on. He spends however much time he wants between our two homes which is atleast 2-3 days at my house, sometimes more depending on his needs for the week. 

He can function pretty well on his own, he can be left alone for a couple hours a day. He can interact and most people could probably tell he has some social awkwardness. He's been feeling very bored lately and restless. He has a very poor self image and I feel it may be good if he gets a job outside the house. 

Over the summer I gave him yard work and around the house work to do for spending money. He doesn't particularly enjoy outdoor work that he can't do at his own pace. He's also interested in getting a job outside the house but he gets overwhelmed so easily and lashes out or shuts down.

However, I‚Äôve noticed over the past few years I‚Äôve started to gain more ‚Äústereotypical‚Äù autistic traits...

Large, open areas or areas with lots of people bother me and I get very anxious (think shopping districts, malls, grocery stores). I‚Äôm incredibly irritable when I have a plan in my mind and it changes, and I also get really combative easily with people who are close to me.

See....I didn't fully understand why she'd made such an attempt to get me back (well, not a genuine attempt, but you know what I mean) when I dumped her; and asked her if she saw what was going on ""behind the scenes"" that I otherwise had not been privy to.

&amp;#x200B;

Then...it hit me...

&amp;#x200B;

I remembered as far back as when she and I had started dating, her Mom insisted she be home at a very specific time, refused to let her go to certain places, and just kept telling me to ""leave this or that alone"", that she would take care of it, and all that.

&amp;#x200B;

Well today...it all clicked:

&amp;#x200B;

Her Mom knew. Her Mom knew the whole time she was cheating with every guy all over the place. She was just hoping she could get her to deviate from her bad decisions soon enough and stay on the straight &amp; narrow with me, and by keeping me in the dark about everything and just put on the most amazing presentation, it would all work out in the end for me and her daughter.

&amp;#x200B;

Welp...one big wrench in the gears that came along was...her Mom \*died\*.

&amp;#x200B;

She can't keep her on the straight &amp; narrow, and deviate from her bad decisions, if she's no longer there. I was going thru a very difficult time at that point with my Dad becoming terminally ill anyway, so to cope with all of this, she doubled down on her already terrible behavior.

&amp;#x200B;

It all fits now. Yes, it's been almost 8 years now, but even still...it felt so good to finally put those puzzle pieces together; it's something you all know we get a kick out of.

"Fiancee is on the verge of leaving me because of the difficulties that my autism brings to the relationship, so I'm going to consoling to see if I can make any progress.","So I (26M) have level 1 ASD. I have been in a relationship with my fiancee (25f) NT for 2.5 years. We have had issues with our relationship from the start, and over the years a lot of it has been associated with my Autism. Most of my issues involve communication, understanding what people are saying sometimes, having difficulty remembering things, having trouble thinking things through, having difficulty hearing what people are saying,  losing focus quite often, and sometimes throwing temper tantrums like a child. 

Because of these issues my fiancee is on the verge of ending our relationship and kicking me out of the house. She says that I'm not trying to act like an adult and she thinks I'm getting worse. 

I am trying my best to act like an adult and no matter what I do it seems like the wrong thing, and it is incredibly frustrating for me as well. 

I'm also terrified of her leaving me, mainly because of how supportive shes been with trying to help me through my issues, she's gotten me back on track with my life, and she has brought me into a family that actually cares about my opinion (unlike my parents or brother who don't value my opinion, and my brother is always going to be the favorite in my parents eyes whether they admit it or not). So if I have to go, its back to an environment that isn't beneficial to helping me work through my disability. Also because even though I work full time, I don't make enough to live on my own. So I'll be stuck at my parents till I find a second job. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. I am going to see a therapist because my job offers 3 free sessions, but what if that doesn't help? What if she leaves me and I'm stuck in a toxic environment? What if no matter how hard I try I just cannot mitigate my autistic symptoms that are causing issues in our relationship? I just need some advice or just some words of encouragement because I'm really really struggling right now.

I was waiting for the second bus to arrive and a lot of people started gathering, which created a lot of noise. 
The worst part was that some guy who is basically my ""rival"" was throwing rocks at the bus stop I was in.

Mom refuses to help my 18 year old autistic brother- how can I help him?,"My brother was taken out of school in the 5th grade and ""homeschooled."" (That's in quotes because she's hardly taught him anything.)

He's had little interaction with people other than a weekly youth group, where he is ignored for the most part. There were kids he talked to once or twice because THEY started the conversation, and he's upset they haven't started any other conversations with him.

I feel terrible for him because of the lack of help he's received. He's really upset that a girl who talked to him twice last year hasn't talked to him again, although she may not even renember him.

My mom refuses to send him to therapy or anything. I hate seeing him so frustrated over his lack of attention, but I'm not sure what to do. 

Also, my parents want to toss him into a special care home at some point. I hate that idea. He struggles, but if they actually worked with him, he could live himself. He can make food, stay hygienic, and he cares for a cat he loves dearly by himself. That's not a person who needs special services. 

So, I'm open to any ideas. What can I do to help him?  I can't take him anywhere because I'm 16 with no drivers licence. I hate what's happening here, and i would hate to see his life ruined by the choices of my parents.",autism,1574209784,tbrowawayaccount1,22,4,True,2019-11-19

I think my kid got framed at school. Am I being paranoid?,"I got a call from the school today that my kiddo had broken a few things while at school. They said there were witnesses so I assumed my kid had a meltdown and released frustration in a destructive way. It would not be the first time, but it has been several years since something like this has occurred and never at this level. I was ready to make my kid pay for the damages and take whatever discipline was handed down.

Here is the problem: kiddo is adamant this is not true and was truly surprised and puzzled by the accusations. When I tell you I gave this child every opportunity to come clean, I mean EVERY opportunity. The look on my kid‚Äôs face, demeanor, vocal inflection and body language all tell me to trust and believe my child.

I‚Äôm not sure how to convince the school that they got bad information but maybe it is a lost cause. It is 2 other kids against my one, who has a past of being difficult.

I‚Äôm too biased. I need to know if it makes sense to go to bat for my kid. I feel like it is the right thing to do, but if I find out afterwards that my child did do this, I will be both crushed and embarrassed.

Not allowed to have an assessment even though I think it would help,"This is going to be long, I'm sorry. I'll try to at least break it into sections. I don't really have a support network around me so I don't know where else I could talk about this or ask for advice.

So, I've kind of taken it for a fact that there's something ""off"" about me for as long as I can remember. 

I didn't get on well with other children as a kid. I got engrossed in my books and drawings and kept myself away from other people to what was considered an unhealthy degree. People used to say I lived in my own head. I used to be very vocal about the fact that I do not miss company anyway but that got me pinned as a bad person so I eventually stopped saying it.   
I had to train myself to smile at people because it did not come naturally. Just kinda had a blank face I suppose that people read as me being mad. Similar case with eye contact. With not grimacing a lot when it's inappropriate. Not flailing my limbs around because people got mad. Not sitting in very strange almost gymnastics like pretzel positions because people thought it's weird. Not turning my back to people if they try to talk to me when I'm occupied.

I also have what I consider to be obvious sensory issues. Always keeping it only dimly lit inside. Wear earphones at all times, don't like crowds, even had a whole curled up on the floor, covering ears, not letting people touch me screaming fit at least once. Talking to someone is ungodly levels of exhausting.

A lot of behaviours I sort of ""trained myself out of"" around others. Learned little scripts for conversations.  
I'm in my 20s now. However, it all feels very phony and takes way too much effort. I cannot really relate to other people the way I pretend to. And I feel guilty over not being honest but I can't be. I still swing my legs on chairs. I still poke the fork on the table instead of looking at people who are talking to me. I still drop the forced smile when I get tired. I still don't get things I obviously should. I still let inappropriate comments slip out. And every time I get looks and people get mad at me. It's not that I intentionally break the rules, I have to blindly guess rules I don't know inherently.

These things have always caused me difficulties but now as an adult I feel like not having my needs met and having to conform so much takes away energy I should be putting into my responsibilities. This is taking a really big toll at this point. I'm too drained to work on my own life and everybody is mad at me all the time because they think I'm rude on purpose.

I'm very much suspecting I might of have some sort of autism spectrum disorder or at least something that manifests itself similarly. I've always found an uncanny comfort with other people who have been diagnosed as being on the spectrum. In fact I've even been evaluated once but it was just quizzing my parents and I don't feel like that is very realiable. By that time I was in my teens and learned to hide a ton of behaviours even from them. Especially from them in some cases.

I'm not looking for an excuse for why I'm rude or why I can't work on things as well as I'm supposed to. Not even looking for a written official diagnosis necessarily. I'm just looking for a confirmation that these specific things are hard for me, and a bit of patience. Maybe an opt-out from certain things so that I can put that effort into more important stuff.

I've been attending a psychiatrist but as far as I can tell she seems a little hostile. Having therapists assume I'm trying to be manipulative or get hostile when I'm unable to answer accusatory rapid fire questions has been an ongoing struggle for me. I swear to god I have no intention to be manipulative. My best guess is that I get confused and intimidated way too often to come off as believable. Talking to them is just as much of a guessing game as talking to anyone else is.

I desperately want to get some sort of help with this but I'm worried. While I wouldn't be ashamed of myself if I turned out to have some sort of disability my family wouldn't take it well. Help would be crucial though. I don't want to have to keep fighting a therapist. I don't know how to convince them to just give at least asking me a couple of things a chance. I have no power here. If I'm insistent I'm manipulative. If I'm timid and confused I'm lying. I'd just like to be able to exist in peace.

But friendships, for aspies anyway, are a lot like relationships where you have to ask questions, tell them about your self, and invite them to hang out.

Which therapy can help target these behaviors? ABA or OT.  What can i do at home to help him? When hes having an outburst i just hug him real tight and tell him how much i love him.  I know he cant understand me but i hope one day he can sense how much i love him.

"Study of Online and In-Person Community Experiences of People on the Spectrum, Illinois Tech (Chicago, IL)","Hi All!

I'm a clinical psychology PhD student conducting a research study with Illinois Institute of Technology that examines online and community experiences of adults on the autism spectrum. I thought that reddit would be a great place to find people engaged online who might be interested in helping psychologists learn about their community experiences. 

To participate, you must be:

* diagnosed with an autism spectrum condition (including ASD, Asperger's, PDD-NOS, etc)
* aged 18 or older
* your own guardian and able to complete the survey independently
* living in the United States
* fluent in English at least at a 6th grade level

This is an anonymous, one-time, online survey that takes 20-30 minutes to complete, and asks about you, your community habits, and your online habits. At the end, there is an option to enter your personal email to be entered into a drawing for a $25 Amazon gift card.

If you are interested, the survey link is [https://tinyurl.com/IITPsychology](https://tinyurl.com/IITPsychology)

If you have any questions, please email me at srafajko@iit.edu. Thanks!

P.S. Please let me know if it is against any community rules to post this here, and I will promptly remove. Also, please feel free to distribute this to any other individuals, groups, or organizations that may have an interest. I will post a synopsis of my study results upon completion of the study.",autism,1574276426,psych-researcher,1,1,True,2019-11-20

Future topics would cover productivity, energy management, attitude/self perception, small talk, ...

The doc that diagnosed him said that that will cause the education system to stuff with unnecessary pills to keep him docile in class.

"What are three things you would change about social media (generally, and specifically for your personality/triggers/etc.)? [x-post, /r/autistic]","I've created a social network (I prefer ""community"" since good communities don't allow harassment/bullying/etc.).

The community site is the opposite of Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Tumblr, etc., in that it's designed for ""the people Silicon Valley forgot"". This includes neurodiverse people -- especially autistic and/or those of us with Asperger's -- since lots of techie people are ""high functioning"" but still fit somewhere on the spectrum, even if we're not diagnosed.

We don't use advertising (since ads are surveillance that follows you around the web), so the site will cost about $3 per month. For now, though, it's free while we work out the bugs and create features everyone wants most.

I recently opened the site for people to play with and make suggestions, and told people on Twitter about it. Of course, one of the first people who signed up immediately, seemed to really love the site and gave great suggestions, was autistic! Then a family member of hers died, she disabled/deleted her Twitter account and I haven't heard from her since then (if you're reading this, I hope you're okay).

So you don't have to sign up and become a member, but I want to make the new site as welcoming as possible for people on the spectrum. I'd be happy even  if this became ""the social network for autistic people"", and everyone else would have to start by being accepted into our community first, rather than the other way around. :)

I need the advice on how to deal with an autistic kid who has a crush on me,"I started my first year of college and ran into a friend within the first week. One of his old family friends from boy scouts long ago came up to us and I said hello and introduced myself and him the same. I knew right away something was off and my frined later confirmed my suspicions that he is autistic. I was friendly and since then would see him without my friend and would continue to be nice. This kid will not leave me alone though. I mean I will be walking to myself or having a break in between and he will come up to where I am and linger about 5 feet away and not say anything unless I make direct eye contact or initiate a conversation. If I do, he will stay unless I excuse myself (which I have been doing much more recently because it's been tiring the last few months to converse with him as he keeps commenting on the way I look and I end up just feeling uncomfortable). 

Just last week, I was at my retail job and this kid passes by the store and I barely make eye contact with him and I tell my manager and other coworker that someone just saw me and I do not want them to know I work there. My other coworker looks out and sees him turn around and head back towards our store. I go into the back and about a minute later my manager tells me that what she just saw was incredibly strange; the kid walks past the store storing inside and looking around (for me obviously). About ten minutes later he leading against the railing and does the same thing one more time.

A few days later at school I see him again but try to avoid him intensely. He does him whole coming within 5 feet and lingering and I just blurt out to my friends how I was out of town and just got back the night prior (total BS). 

The next night I see my one friend that introduced me and autistic kid, and asked him for his advice, and he told me he could try talking to him but there is really nothing he could do. I feel a bit defeated but try not to worry about it as I hope I really only have to deal with the kid at school, and hopefully not my retail job again nor my serving job. 

The next day (Saturday), I am serving on the patio of the restaurant (meaning I'm the only server) and The autistic kid, his mom, and friends from Switzerland come upstairs and I have to serve them. I couldn't believe the chances of this kind finding out both of my jobs, and am actually a bit scared now. I was friendly though and discovered how sweet his mom was. As expected, the kid was awkward and not really good at socializing but tried nonetheless. I gave them their milkshakes and fries anyways and gave them a discount on their meal. 

A week after the first time the kid saw me at my retail job (so yesterday), He passes by AGAIN but I don't know if he saw me because he never passed by again. My managers told me if it becomes such an issue they are going to tell him he is not welcome in our store.

I feel terrible for this kid because I'm sure all he wants is to feel included but I have been nice for long enough and I really feel helpless considering he knows both of my jobs and just waits for me at school. I want to know a perspective from someone with autism, what this kid might be thinking/feeling, as well as ways to talk to him and tell him that it is not okay for him to come to my jobs and follow me.

"""Normal"" as a child, know as the weird guy now. What happened?","Hello all,

Trying to make sense of my life, posting here in the hopes that someone can provide some insight.
Some background about me:

I was extremely high energy as a child and had behavioral problems, it was diagnosed as ADD early on and eventually sorted itself out as I grew older. During this time I had no problems talking to people and I could express emotion very freely.

Fast forward to middle school:
I became very shy and reserved, I developed a flat affect rarely expressing emotion on my face, and I preferred to spend most of my time alone usually in my room.

Fast forward to adulthood:
These problems still persisted, I have extreme difficulty even making eye contact with people and around others I rarely feel any emotion other than anxiety. I have a naturally angry looking face to begin with, so the lack of emotion pretty much serves as a further barrier in people avoiding me. And I honestly can't blame them when I put myself in their perspective.

I want to know what the hell changed that made me this way? I sought a diagnosis from a licensed psychologist who diagnosed me with aspergers traits. This would explain a lot of my life, but it still dosen't seem to fully fit.

I'm not denying this, I know autism is a spectrum with different levels of functioning, but it still does not explain why I wasn't this way as a child. I had behavioral problems, but I never displayed traits of ASD. So what I really want to know is what the hell happened that made me this way?

4 Questions for Young Adults with Autism (or their Parents/Friends),"Hi,

I have four questions for young people with Autism (ages 12-35).

&amp;#x200B;

(1) What strengths do you most use when you plan and execute a new routine in your life?  


(2) Could you share a quick drawing or sketch of ""How to get from your house to the grocery store""? ¬†(I am trying to understand what are good ways to illustrate a journey from one place to another)  


(3) Could you share a link to a website or a game or a map that you really like and use often?¬† Could you share what you like about it?  


(4) ¬†In your experience, what is the most difficult part of planning and executing a new routine?

Nothing I collect will be published anywhere -- I'm just asking to get a better sense of what would be good and helpful as a design for the final tool.  :)

"Parents, siblings or grandparents of children with Autism? Am I in the right place to understand your world?","Hi all - I'm interested in learning about autism, and specifically about the challenges that parents, guardians, grandparents and siblings face as opposed to autistic people's experiences directly.

I'm a designer, and a good friend of mine has developed a product that would likely be considered music therapy, or potentially ""healing"" music. He has had some wonderful results with autistic children where listening to the music has allowed them to develop their speech or to say their first words after years of silence. Granted much of the evidence is anecdotal, but I believe there's something happening that I think is positive.

My job is to understand the challenges faced by parents of autistic children in order to understand how best to approach presenting the music to them in a way that will make sense.

People Over 25/30 Who Are Still Single / Friendless. What Keeps You Motivated To Keep Going?,"Hello Everyone.

I am 27 now and despite the best medical and therapeutic interventions I am still not very good with people. I was mute till age 7 and I have done my best to assimilate into society but I am still not a member of it. I have done the usual rounds, I have been medicated and still am. I have done all natures of therapy. I masked for many many years but it still did not help me. I find modern life and the social aspect an area where I simply have not thrived.

As I have entered my late twenties it has become more difficult as the few people who did accept me have now gotten careers and partners and simply don't have my time anymore. I have not done well in dating as I have only ever attracted predatory people and I don't know how to function in romantic relationships.

It seems the big things which most people around me are into are careers and romance at my age. I've thrived in neither.

There are many young people here but my question is more for those who are older. How do you keep going? What motivates you to keep going for those of us who are still single and still isolated and friendless. I'm very happy for the people who have partners and jobs etc but this is more for those who don't.

Emptyness,"Vent post*

I am at the point of my life where i feel empty and cant remember the last time i felt happy. Despite my achievements in getting where i am now i still feel inadequate and weak as a person.

Autism has been a big part of my life , and i have a love hate relationship with it throughout my life. Those who know me for many years , have seen the struggles i have faced and know how it affects me.

Time and time again , i am back to this low point where i ask myself why am i like this , why cant i be normal like most people and it pushed my feelingd away from society. I am ashamed being different , i am ashamed that i cant do most things like others do and the biggest shame to me is being exempted from National service (2 years manditory army) that alienated me from people making me feel weak.

I thought  there can be only one option and that is to move forward , work harder and show the world by putting effort in what i am passionate about by making impact in the work i do in a startup is the way to validate myself that i am indeed capable.

So i work towards that , for 2 years i focus alot of my energy into learning and practicing programming as much as i can. In this timeline i changed ,  grew alot and met alot of people along the way.

I was happy and achieved alot but it was short term and yet it still didnt get rid of the feeling of inadequacy i felt,  and eventually i felt my achievements were nothing despite people telling me how happy for me.

I think more imptly despite my growth i felt i lost something important.

 for example doing my uni grad, i simply took the paper and walk off feeling like it was no big deal and i wasnt good enough.

I thought it was just burnout from putting too much time in work, so i tried different activities after my first pay explored different places bars and what not.

But i just dont feel happy anymore , and now that i think about it i cant remember the last time i was truly happy and the overwhelming feeling of being inadequate haunts again and the same questions pop up .

I know people will say that i shouldnt compare others achievements or try to tell me nice things about autism. 

 I do appreciate them and understand them logically , but my feeling about it is something i cant accept.",autism,1574356257,YuukiSAan,5,1,True,2019-11-21

A question for those with a late diagnosis.,"My son will be ten years old in February. Several times over the past year he‚Äôs brought up autism. Sometimes he asks if he‚Äôs autistic and we‚Äôve just never told him. A couple of days ago he came to me and said he wanted to be tested for autism. I texted this to my ex, and to my surprise he agreed we should get him tested, just to put his mind at rest if he isn‚Äôt, and give him validation if he is. However, he says he doubts that someone with autism would be asking if they are autistic. I asked my son what would he think if he didn‚Äôt get an autism diagnosis. He said it would be okay, and just mean that he‚Äôs a special kid. He is definitely a unique child, unlike any I‚Äôve ever known, and I think he realizes he‚Äôs different from his peers and wants to know if there‚Äôs a reason.

What Are the Symptoms of Autism?

* Spoken language 
* Gestures and reaction on inappropriate things
* Eye contact
* Facial expressions
* Tone of voice
* Expressions not meant to be taken literally

**Other Autism Symptoms and signs that can have in your child**

# Is Homeopathy is the best treatment for ASD?

* Homeopathy is completely safe.
* It does not have side effects like other treatments.
* ASD is a developmental condition, homeopathy helps to removes blocks that prevent development.
* Homeopathy treatment is not much expensive like any other medicine.

Late diagnosis/realisation,"I'm a 31yo male, I just considered that I might be on the spectrum. It is probable that I'm not, but I wish to ask you since you are knowledgeable.    

I was an odd kid but I went through life without any big issues. The older I got the more I realised that I am not operating at the same wavelength as those around me. I always ascribed it to difficult upbringing and my personality.
I graduated with a psych major (UK really Psych Bachelors) and never considered this possibility. I thought about personality disorders etc.
Now that I look back and look at my current self it dawned on me I might be on the spectrum. Though I don't want to cause any disrespect to people who are struggling. 
I have problems in social situations, I don't like gatherings, which lead me to alcohol dependency. I avoid family, taking of feelings, I feel awkward. 
I don't know if it's my personality or am I on spectrum. I have had relationships and what many would call normal life, it just always felt off and a chore. 
I hope some of you could advise on what to do, am I looking at the right thing.

Relationships with Autism (NSFW),"Hi all.

I am a woman with autism and I've recently entered into a romantic relationship with a close friend. It's all going really well, but I get overwhelmed by being with her physically. I'm attracted to her and I want to do sexual things with her, but I don't know how not to get overwhelmed with the sensory stuff. I'm also scared on not liking what we are doing and freaking out on her and making her feel like she was forcing me to do stuff I don't want to.

A thank you to the community,"I just want to say thank you to every single autistic person on this subreddit for your contribution every day.

I have lurked for a while and only recently began commenting.

Thank you all for talking about your struggles, your interests, worries and frustrations.

I really really want to thank the people who have helped open my eyes to ABA therapy. Through a stroke of luck, my son hasn't had ABA yet. First I declined because he was starting pre-k and I wanted to see him adapt to that setting first without throwing him in the deep end of the pool. Then the ABA place in my city that everyone recommends has a year long wait list. I used to view ABA as something we would try eventually.

But you all have opened my eyes. With talk about your own personal experience with ABA, I saw that it was a terrible horrifying thing. I am so sorry you all went through this.  I am so sorry you were punished for being yourself.

Not all parents are perfect and I truly believe most had good ""intentions"" when signing their child up for ABA because they thought it would help like other therapies(speech &amp; OT), but after being here a little while listening your stories and researching online I truly believe ABA is damaging.

ABA destroys your chance for self love. ABA tells you it's not ok to feel the way you feel and that your responses to a situation are not ""normal"", and because they are not ""normal"" they are not acceptable.

Well eff that. I think you all are fantastic, kind, gracious, very very patient, and funny. I like you just the way you are.

Off topic: Mr. Rogers was really onto sometime ahead of his time when he would say ""I like you just the way you are.""  What better example could we follow than his?

Thank you for sharing your stories and experiences. I hope your voices will be heard loud and clear and that the next generation of autistic people were saved by their very own fiercely advocating for the abuse to stop.",autism,1574400671,Crazymomma2018,3,1,True,2019-11-22

I know it's not his fault and I feel awful for getting mad at him. For example when I'm gaming, he will just start repeating everything I say in different voices.

Just want to go for a bit of a rant here.,"I've been out of the job for three months. And now it's hard for me to find another.

The truth is, I was so traumatized by my last two experiences with work that I am really afraid of finding a job again. Last job asked me to resign because there was no way they could handle my autism, and my other job had such a high turnover rate and had poor management that everything was stressful 24/7. Even after I disclosed my autism to my later boss, there was nothing they could do to accommodate for me. They only kept me because they needed people to keep a ratio.

I'm too afraid of finding work again, of having to disclose my autism again, that whenever I see that release form saying that I have a disability that I am relieved and always click yes, so at least they have a reference. But otherwise, I am afraid of being in another company that doesn't know how to work with an autistic employer.

I have sent in a referral for the local Vocational Rehabilitation office in Hope's that they could help me. But even trying to find help with government agencies in the past was unhelpful. I insisted I needed VR and vocational assessments, but the last job coach I had was insistent that because I have a bachelor's, that all she needed to do was fill out applications and hoped one of them stuck. The very last time I saw her, I left crying because she didn't listen to a word I say. 

So ... of course I am afraid of VR. Especially since they have me attending an 'orientation' ... I'm a little sketch. I really wanted a personal one-on-one meeting with a counselor. They didn't even say what the orientation will cover. I'm afraid it's just going to be like the job coach like before.

They don't see that my work experience was ... rigid. I had purely taking-care-of-people experience before, and I don't want that anymore. I don't want to please or take care of people anymore. Does that make me a bad person?

And then there's no chance of me being able to sign up for disability. I've not enough evidence that I have autism except for an evaluation done way back in 2006. I need to go to doctors and show them my best history of IEPs and disability stuff, and they would still be like ""well ... you worked before, right?""

I wish there was a cheaper way to receive a diagnosis.,"I know psychiatrists need to make their money, but I can‚Äôt stand the fact that I would need around $3000 just to receive a diagnosis for autism, because I certainly can‚Äôt afford that, with or without insurance! I know some would say it doesn‚Äôt make a difference to have a diagnosis, but I beg to differ. 

So, for starters, I am absolutely positive that I am autistic! Unfortunately, I can‚Äôt say I am without a piece of paper to show as ‚Äúproof‚Äù that I am, or I risk being seen as a poser or something. 

If I did want to tell people, then I‚Äôd have to tell my whole embarrassing life story, and explain what autism really is! Just so others can get a better understanding of it, and then they can decide for themselves if they believe me or not. 
When I could just show them a piece of paper and be done with it! 

I feel like I can never talk about my issues, because of this! I can‚Äôt talk about my issues without feeling judged, because the way I am isn‚Äôt completely ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. I feel it‚Äôs unacceptable to say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm like this because I‚Äôm autistic‚Äù if I don‚Äôt have ‚Äúproof‚Äù of it, and that‚Äôs so horrible IMO! Without a diagnosis, there‚Äôs no way to explain to anyone why I am the way I am! 

Without a diagnosis I am forced to live my life pretending to be someone I‚Äôm not, because it‚Äôs just easier for everyone that way. I feel like I have to wear a mask and try super hard to fit in, otherwise I‚Äôd be judged or questioned about what‚Äôs going on with me, even if nothing is wrong! 

Sorry, I don‚Äôt make eye contact all the time, and don‚Äôt remember to smile when I feel happy, or laugh when I think your joke is funny! I can‚Äôt help it! It frustrates me that nobody knows I can‚Äôt help it, and I know can‚Äôt just tell them either. 

When I do these things, people think I‚Äôm either annoyed by them, in a bad mood, I‚Äôm uninterested, or I‚Äôm just lost in thought. When, truthfully, I‚Äôm looking away because I actually am listening! I‚Äôm not smiling, because it‚Äôs just not an automatic thing for me to smile every single time I feel joy! 

That being said, that‚Äôs actually the least of my concerns, since I hardly ever deal with people IRL. Although, it would be really nice to let my friends know, so they can understand me a little better. I‚Äôd really just like a diagnosis so I can get ‚Äútreatment‚Äù for my ‚Äúsymptoms‚Äù. 

I honestly feel I DO need a diagnosis, because I can‚Äôt learn everything from the internet! 

I want to learn more social skills, without having to go through a long process of trial and error. That would take a very long time, since I hardly ever go anywhere or see anyone! (I‚Äôm not a hermit by choice, just as an FYI lol)

I also want to know how to cope with the overwhelming anxiety I get when I meet someone new, or when I‚Äôm around ANY group of people! For me, it‚Äôs really hard to follow the conversation (in person) when there‚Äôs more than two people in the group. Everything just sounds like gibberish when people are talking over each other, and I also never know who to pay attention to or who‚Äôs saying what. It can be pretty embarrassing to feel like the slow one of the group. 

Bottom line is, I want to learn how to be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù without having to struggle so much to accomplish that! 

Without a diagnosis, though, I‚Äôm afraid I just can‚Äôt get that kind of help. Which means I‚Äôll always have to wear a mask and hide who I really am. 

I don‚Äôt want everyone I meet to know, because some people are obviously not going to understand, or even care. I would, however, like to have the option of telling certain people if I wanted to, so they can get to know me better. 

It would really help to take some weight off my shoulders if I didn‚Äôt have to explain a whole bunch of stuff to people, so that I‚Äôm not being misunderstood. 

Idk why I‚Äôm even posting this, other than to vent I guess.... Who knows? Maybe my post will help someone who‚Äôs feeling the same way, and reading this will make them feel less like an alien stranded on a strange planet. 

I know autistic people already feel like aliens, but I feel especially like an alien, since I don‚Äôt even have proof of being autistic! Therefore, I feel like I have no right to talk about it to anyone who does have proof. I know that‚Äôs probably not true, that‚Äôs just how I feel is all!

Anaphylaxis symptoms in kids who can't speak,Hi everyone. I work at a center for kids with autism and several have life threatening food allergies. Our kiddos cannot speak and some are only able to use picture exchange. They may not understand that we can help them if something in their bodies go wrong and likely won't approach us for help. Learning those skills is of course a priority but will take a long time and we need to know now. There are sometimes physical signs like hives but not always. Those of you who know people with anaphylactic allergies who cannot express their symptoms out loud: What behavioural changes do you see in them that indicate an anaphylactic reaction? (P.S.

Started my second job today...,"I feel like breaking down and crying for the next few hours. Not because I don‚Äôt like my job, the change is just a LOT. Today was a lot. I work 8am-1pm on weekdays at a job I‚Äôve had for the past year, and also for the past year I‚Äôve been living paycheck to paycheck, consistently spending my last $20 on gas a day or two before payday. I‚Äôm so fed up with that, I went and got a second job. Full time because why not, working is fine and the more time I spend at work the less time I have to either spend money elsewhere or sitting around eating and being lazy. 

So anyway today I worked 13 hours for the first time in like 5 years. One day at my first ‚Äúreal‚Äù job (not paid ‚Äòunder the table‚Äô) I ended up working 13 hours because of a huge assignment that needed to be done, but today I left one job in the next city over, got on the highway, got off and began my second job. These are just training hours, I will have a few hours to go home and relax between jobs once I get into the regular shifts. Needless to say it was EXHAUSTING but fun, I will mostly be by myself which is nice, and making nearly twice the amount of money as my first job. So in total I‚Äôll be making 3x the money in the same two week period, which is really great in my opinion. I spent the first 5 hours reading SOP‚Äôs and materials and taking quizzes, it felt like I was cramming for the SAT‚Äôs all over again. My head is spinning but I think I have a handle on things. 

I‚Äôm also getting a lot of pressure from my first boss because he doesn‚Äôt think the schedules are gonna work out even though I verified with new company multiple times that it would. 

I‚Äôm kind of venting but have any of you done anything similar? Changed your routine so abruptly and drastically and done it entirely of your own accord?

Need Help on Writing Autistic Character for Script.,"Hey!

I'm writing a script about an autistic girl in a haunted house. It would deal with the ideas of communication and perception.

Considering I'm not autistic myself, I'm quite limited in terms of understanding of how it feels.

I know autism encompasses a large range of experiences, but I'm not quite sure I understand the 'boundaries' if there are any.

I imagine hyper-sensitive senses like this: https://youtu.be/K2P4Ed6G3gw

How would *you* translate your experience into film?

How do I work on giving too much to others and sharing things I can‚Äôt afford to share,"So basically I really struggle wording my affection for my friends and stuff, so I like to give them gifts or share things I think they‚Äôd like, I‚Äôm not trying to buy their love, but it‚Äôs just the easiest way I can physically show them how much they mean to me, I used to jokingly punch and slap friends without realising that it wasn‚Äôt okay because it‚Äôs how my brother and I showed affection as kids when I was growing up


Sometimes I try wording that I really care about my friends, but I don‚Äôt feel like it proves how much I really do care, it takes a lot for me to be friends with someone, so once they‚Äôre my friend it means they really matter to me and I want them to know that I love and care about them and I‚Äôm always there, I still say those things but I also like giving physical proof to back up my words since I like evidence and proof for everything I do.

The issue with this is that people have taken advantage of me in the pat because of this, and I genuinely can‚Äôt afford to buy my friends gifts sometimes or share things, but I still go and use the last few bucks I have to do something nice for them, especially if they‚Äôve been having a tough time

My co worker and good friend (I just moved to the big city from a small town and don‚Äôt have a lot of friends) is also autistic and so she try‚Äôs to help me not over spend when we hang out, but she also struggles with saying no and how to react to gifts.

DAE find that simply being with others helps to regulate emotions?,"I don't know how much emotional dysregulation is inherently part of autism, but it does seem like something a lot of us struggle find.

The situation that prompted this post, as an example: I had a chemistry lab where we needed to conduct an experiment with another person. I accidentally spilled some product, and normally I probably would have started freaking out because I didn't know what do.

I am working on a school project where the main subject is Autism; i am in need of this subreddits insight,"Disclaimer; english is not my first language  


Of course there is tons of other places i could go to find empirically proven information about people on the spectrum, but besides that i would very much love to hear what other people's thoughts are on the questions further down this text.  
Both in my own interest, and for me to have a bit of direct interaction with different individuals with different kinds of autism wich will probably help me a lot in this process for school.  


Okay now on to the matter at hand; the projects is as follows:  
Based on a ton of research (both practical and literature), i will be writing a ''book'' containing general guidelines for high school teachers (and other figures in high school with a function of authority) on the following matters.  


\-How to have healthy interaction with a student that is on the spectrum. (do's and dont's regarding the emotional/social vulnerability of the individual).  
\-How to stimulate and assist students that are on the spectrum with their learning and working processes in a non contra-productive and healty way.  
\-How to recognize undiagnosed high functioning Children/adolescents with autism in class/at school. (A lot of a childs time is spent at school so it is an area where a lot of signs can go unnoticed or noticed when one knows what to look for.  


Put a question mark behind the 'how to' sentences above and you got yourself the questions i mentioned further up in this text.  
I hope i have given enough valuable information, if you need anything, please tell me.  
I hope you people can help me out.

Inpatient psychiatry help with accommodation,"TW: Suicide


Hey Reddit,

I'm currently staying at an inpatient psychiatric facility because I am a danger to myself due to elevated suicidal ideation (I did not attempt suicide, although I was extremely close).  I'm trying to get better so I can get out of here ASAP as being held is extremely distressing to me as a person with autism.  Unfortunately, the staff have removed my cell phone without regard to the distress that this has caused me.  My entire support network is online, as I have quite poor social skills, and I use the phone to text with my therapist regularly.  I am also very uncomfortable communicating verbally, especially with new people, of which this entire hospital is full of them.  Obviously they do not want me to have charging cables as they could be used to harm myself, but they also have charging cables at the nursing station that they do charge phones with.  I have tried to advocate for myself on why this is so needed for me, especially in this time of crisis, however the hospital is not budging.  Does anyone have any advice for this situation in order to get a proper accommodation?

We have to accept things we cannot change - but that doesn't mean we should mischaracterize reality and autism still seems like damage, not just difference. Am I getting that wrong? Why do people think so?

We all have damage in some way. Maybe you're diabetic. Have depression. Are missing a limb. Or are below average intelligence in some area.

What I would Like Everyone to Know as An Individual With Autism,"Why Did I type so much?
Well it‚Äôs easier for me to speak out through writing then speaking as I am quite shy and an introvert(not sensitive though.  I am quite patient as I learned during my younger years to be calm).  I can speak but my terminology will make less sense and I will over generalize to much when conversing with individuals.
I know with the amount I typed I might seem like a nerd but I really ain‚Äôt.  I‚Äôm not obsessed with certain franchises like nerds are. I‚Äôm only interested in certain things.  I‚Äôm never obsessed with anything.


General Paragraph About Myself:
I would like everyone to know that I‚Äôm a Gen Z introvert in Grade 11.  I‚Äôm also a normal individual.  I do not like being seen as an autistic person as my autism is very mild. I personally only struggle with social anxiety in crowded environments but otherwise I am a normal person.  I behave a lot like Isaac Newton did back in his time.  I‚Äôm also quite conservative in my political views and I‚Äôm proud to be a patriot of Alberta(however, I respect everyones beliefs).  I am a separate individual and my neighbour is a separate individual in my worldview.  I believe in liberty and individualism.  I‚Äôm also a KJV Bible Christian.  I also am very good at math and science but I struggle in English Literature(accept I am good at short story writing).  I also know a bit of French as I‚Äôm taking French at my high school for a second language.  I live in Alberta Canada.  I spend most of my free time watching YouTube videos, specially European history documentaries. I‚Äôm also in European history AP which is a college level course.  When I go to university in September 2021, I am going to work toward a bachelors, masters and PHD in Astrophysics.   I rarely read books. My reading comprehension skills are terrible(I use to be able to read for hours back when I was in grade 5 but now I can barely read for 10 minutes). When I read, I skim through online articles. As a member of Gen Z, I tend to spend hours on my electronics as I don‚Äôt get much homework either.  In Alberta Canada we get class time to work.

General Interests:
Movies and Video Games
Star Wars Lord of the Rings, Elder Scrolls
History
Napoleonic times, colonialism,  British Empire, European History

Science, Religion and Spirituality
Astrochemistry, astrophysics, astronomy, space. Higher dimensions, parallel universes.  Gospel of Jesus Christ.  Telepathy.

Am I creative or abstract
I am abstract, which explains why math is the easiest subject for me.

How I Experienced Bullying:
Personally,  in middle school from grade 6-8, I got bullied in the form of people saying ‚Äúshhh‚Äù or ‚Äústop it‚Äù or things like ‚Äúwanna be friends‚Äù and then when I talked to them they said ‚Äúshh‚Äù. And stop being annoying‚Äù and then I said back ‚Äúwe are not friends anymore‚Äù and the bullies said back ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt care just stop distracting me from learning‚Äù. This cycle repeated from grade 6-8.  In grade 9(last year of middle school in Alberta), I stopped associating myself with those bullies and I stopped going to those bullies.  I decided to mind my own business and now in high school, my social life is relaxed.  No social pressure nor issues.  I will admit that it was my fault for falling for this and for doing annoying things like making noises in class back in Grade 6-8. 

Me being able to detect Sarcasm:
Also I can easily tell what‚Äôs sarcasm and whats not but it depends on the context. In terms of reading online comments and if the jokes are jokes that I‚Äôm familiar with, then I can easily tell what‚Äôs humour and not. Infact, I can even sense vibes and emotions on the energetic level around people without even talking to them. Just by looking at the individual‚Äôs facial expression, I can easily tell if their are happy or not. If the context is a joke hidden in plain sight, then I wouldn‚Äôt be able to spot humour nor the emotion and vibe of the situation. I can easily detect sarcasm based on the tone of the individual‚Äôs voice. Personally, I have never had anyone ever had to point out sarcasm to me nor jokes(accept when I was under 13 years of age.). I feel like it varies from person to person, some people are able to spot humour, others might not be able to. It‚Äôs a commonly associated stereotype that‚Äôs attributed to autism but in reality, it just varies on the individual. In terms of embarrassment when someone calls me out then yes, however I‚Äôve only had my parents call me out sometimes as a kid, but overall I haven‚Äôt really experienced a situation where I couldn‚Äôt detect humour. I do agree with you that sarcasm isn‚Äôt really that funny. Although I can detect it, I personally don‚Äôt find it funny. Memes however are funny IMO(mainly memes about historical european empires). In my situation, I understand the type of humour that it is but I just don‚Äôt find sarcasm amusing

Some Stereotypes About Autism That are False And do not describe me as an individual:
*Autistic people are a separate identity
Wrong! Autistic people are individuals.  Each and every individual in someway(or more depending on the context) is different.  
*Autistic People hate being lonely 
Wrong. It depends on the individual‚Äôs personality.  Personally I like being alone as I get my personal space.
*Autistic people are nerds
Wrong.  Depends on the individual. Although my interests are nerdy, I do not behave like a nerd.  I have autistic friends who like sports and is obsessed with transportation and the transit system, trains and buses.(which I dislike).
*Autistic People are liberals and atheists
Another stereotype I feel is false.  Autism doesn‚Äôt determine an individual‚Äôs personal beliefs.  I personally am a KJV Bible Christian, patriot, a bit spiritual and conservative.  I do believe in spirit and flesh as well and I try not to follow flesh.  I feel like this stereotype arose from the ongoing political correctness in our modern world.
*Autistic People are depressed
Again autism does not determine these things.  It‚Äôs the individual‚Äôs circumstances and beliefs that do.  I personally am far from depressed.  I am quite spoiled as well.  I‚Äôm living a positive life.(I do however get over stressed in English Language arts class).  Being depressed is an individualistic thing.",autism,1574604377,MoonWatch986,5,1,True,2019-11-24

does anyone else have possible trauma from aba therapy or other kinds of therapies?,"Trigger warning for being restrained:

when I was 6 my mom made me go to a therapist, not sure if she was aba. She did a lot of not pleasant things and told me stuff that still makes me upset, like that if I didn't work harder to be normal nobody would ever love me or want to be my friend, and that the way I was made me a burden to my parents and that's why I was here, so that I could learn not to be a horrible menace. She let me play with her toys but whenever I played in a way that was ""wrong"", like organizing the plastic cats by breed, she'd slam her hand down on the table and scare me and take them away. The worst thing that I remember is one session she said that today we're going to work on having ""quiet hands and feet"". She asked me if I liked having pressure on me and I said yes, because I did.
 She then put me in weight bracelet restraints on my wrists, tight enough I couldn't slide free. They weren't tied to anything, just were too heavy for scrawny little kid arms to move under the weight of, so my arms were stuck to the floor. I panicked and yelled and tried to kick my legs but she put weight bracelets on them too, and velcroed them tight so I couldn't wiggle out. The bracelets were really itchy and sensory-wise very bad, almost as bad as cotton balls. I yelled at her again but she just said that it was to help me stay still and calm and I just needed to relax. I did not relax, because I was trapped and it was horrible, I struggled so hard to get loose that my shirt rode up my back and my skin rubbed against the carpet and got rug burn. The whole time I was crying and asking her to let me out. She just said that I was being stubborn and needed to relax, and went back to doing paperwork on her desk. When I cried harder she said ""You are having a temper tantrum for attention, so I am going to ignore you and not give you attention until you're calm."" Then went back to paperwork and didn't even glance in my direction. I guess I cried pretty loud but nobody came in to see what was going on. 
She left me there for the whole session, maybe an hour and a half. By that time I was totally shut down and just lying there. When she removed the bracelets she complimented me on how still and calm and quiet I was being. So did my mom in the car ride home, and all through the next week I was quiet and still and obeidient and made no trouble or loud noise or aggressive behaviors. My mom said to my dad that this therapist must be a genius, I was being so good.
The next session I cried in the car on the way there but that wasn't unusual so it wasn't noticed. I walked into the office, heading towards the stuffed cats because maybe if I do a really good job playing with them in the correct way she'll be nice to me. I turned around and saw her standing there holding the weighed bracelets. I screamed and tried to run to the door but she caught me and gently lowered me to the ground. ""Your mom called me, said that last week's session worked so well. She felt she could finally relax. so let's keep up the good work, okay?""
I bit her to get her to release me, then ran out the door, but there wasn't many places I could go. I hit the button on the elevator to go down to the lobby but she caught up with me and put the bracelets on me and took me back. Then it was basically the same, I lay there trapped for an hour while she does paperwork and ignores me. This time I didn't struggle at all. Again for the next week my mom and teacher were amazed at my ""improvement"". 
On the way to the next session I just went bananas and refused to leave the car at all, even when my mom tried to pull me out I held on to the seat tightly. I said that I hated the therapist and she was mean. Finally my mom got fed up and just turned around and didn't take me back.
Later, When I was in a mental hospital when i was 15 they restrained me and it was horrifying and I kept seeing the ceiling of the office which I was forced to stare at. I still cant stand being restrained or held down, and wake up feeling like I can't move my arms or legs. And it's not like it stopped me from stimming anyway.

Scared about going back to school after having a bit of a Breakdown/Meltdown last Friday. [LONG],"15M in London for context

Last Friday my English class had to do a ‚ÄúPublic Speaking‚Äù thing. Basically a week before my teacher gave my class a list of titles to choose from, mine was ‚Äúit‚Äôs time to get off social media‚Äù (ironic considering what I‚Äôm doing now!), and told us to write a speech-type thing about it, ready to prepare to the class. I wrote it, but was terrified of the day because I know people would not be kind (they never are). 

On the day I was one of the first up, I went to the front of the room, shaking, and immediately people started acting out. Yelling, laughing, pulling faces, writing things on pieces of paper and holding them up, etc etc. My teacher is a very nice person but he has little control over the class when they don‚Äôt want to be controlled. Most lessons they do what he says because they like him. 

I started freaking out, I hate attention and especially negative attention. I started to shake worse, fidget non-stop and wringing my hands (something I do when I feel any kind of negative emotion, I can‚Äôt explain it). This made it worse, as the other people in the class (except the 3 who I‚Äôm actually friends with) had the reaction they wanted so got louder and rowdier. My English teacher told them to shut up but they didn‚Äôt listen. He told me to start, the sooner I started the sooner I‚Äôd finish and could sit down.

I started to speak but was so upset and nervous that I stared stammering really badly (that happens when I get nervous, flustered or embarrassed) and that pleased my classmates even more. Something else that tends to happen to me when I‚Äôm nervous or embarrassed (I don‚Äôt know if anyone can explain this but if you can please comment below) is that I start finding it hard to speak. I got to the stage where I couldn‚Äôt say a word, I kept trying but I couldn‚Äôt make a sound. I just kept clearing my throat and trying to speak but ended up sounding like I was gagging. 

My teacher finally took pity on me and told me to sit down. He held me back after the lesson and told me that I wouldn‚Äôt have to redo it, he‚Äôd enter half marks for me so I wouldn‚Äôt have to go through it again, because he saw how distressed I got.

That was last lesson on Friday and I‚Äôm really worried about going back to school tomorrow because knowing people they will really take the piss out of me for it.

"High Functioning Girl with ASD needs help with her friend who is being very dumb. (Help Me, Please)","(19F) To establish my story, I was diagnosed EARLY ON. In order to remain anonymous however, I‚Äôm not going to get into specifics of how that happened. After multiple types of therapy come middle school, I was very independent and no longer needed therapy. 

My ASD is so unrecognizable that I have to TELL people now so they know I have it and that I have my limits. Even though I‚Äôm very high functioning, I sometimes can be the overwhelmed with things or tend to obsess over certain stuff. 

This then leads into my friend. For the sake of anonymity, let‚Äôs call her Jenny. I have many friends, but Jenny is a wild card. What led me to be her friend was how happy and carefree she was. 

Now I see that happiness as her being dumb, and I don‚Äôt mean that in a rude way (even though that may come off as rude to some of you reading this), but she has a good heart. At least I thought she did. 

What really weirds me out is my odd obsession I had over her. If she was in trouble or needed help, I would disregard what I was doing and try and help her. That was last year, and now that I‚Äôve tried getting away from that, my heart is torn. 

To make a long story short, Jenny has been hanging out with a person at our college who has multiple Title IX cases against them. I have heard the stories, and the stuff can‚Äôt be made up. Everything connects and it is VERY TRUE. The stuff this person has done has made me very scared, but I know that they can‚Äôt hurt me. 

Believe or not, I considered this person as someone I thought to be a good. But that‚Äôs how they get to you, they lower people‚Äôs guards down. They may seem friendly and approachable, but underneath they are a manipulative, controlling, sex addict freak. 

I told my friend some of these accounts in hopes of her to stay away. It never worked. This is where her dumbness comes in.  She has reiterated that just because nothing bad has happened to her when she‚Äôs with them means nothing bad is going to happen.

Our friend group is strongly against this person being associated with us, but it‚Äôs gotten to the point that if Jenny goes with this person, another person in the group goes with her in order to keep her safe. Other people have also tried to reason with her, but she just won‚Äôt listen.

I know I sound very cryptic, but the fact of the matter is that I have cared more about this girl than I should. Everyone has told me not to worry, but yet I feel that if someone happens to Jenny it‚Äôs my fault. 

She has broken me down to my very soul and I feel that she has no remorse or idea of doing so. I want to cut all ties with her and move on, but how can I when I‚Äôve had so much good times with her. Of course the bad times have now outweighed those, but for the life of me I‚Äôve been hoping to have the good come back to our friendship. 

So I ask you, what do I do?",autism,1574639495,FilmMagic221,0,1,True,2019-11-24

"does anyone else really, really love fantasy dragons? (or at least loved them when younger?)","mythical creatures are especially creative in their nature: they often have a human-like intellect (and sometimes even a human-like voice), though they may have far-beyond-human abilities and features: wings, tails, pointed ears, fiery breath ...

&amp;#x200B;

It's almost as if, for me, my childhood fascination with dragons (which I'm starting to re-explore now in my twenty's) is about me vicariously loving myself: fantasizing about a world where creatures (or people) that are different than most humans, are loved and welcomed. A world where being different, is a positive, even magical, attribute.

"I think my Girlfriend is Autistic, can someone confirm and advise?","Hi all,

I've (28m) been with my GF (20F) for just over a year now and I've recently began to think she's unknowingly autistic. 

Reasons for me believing this is things such as;

\- She literally has no friends that are girls, she genuinely and always has preferred guys as friends and finds it easier to interact with them.

\- She can be VERY clingy, like want me around her as much as possible, in each room when she's home. 

\- She can be very mood swingy, the smallest little thing could set her off and she's an absolute nightmare to try and get out of it and NEVER apologises or makes the first interaction in resolving anything. She'll go off alone.

\- She gets severe anxiety of doing anything social or attending events like Weddings or parties etc. 

\- She's Dyslexic

\- She's very like non-emotional as in loving. She can seem very cold and lack empathy for peoples sadness or reading about anything brutal or someone dying etc. EXCEPT if it's for a dog which makes another point, dogs are like her outlet, she's at peace when with dogs.

\- She's extremely random, there could be 500 things to do around the house with bigger priorities but she'll get an idea of like going to get everything to start a veg patch in the garden or so.

\- If the house is untidy, it effects her mood a lot.

\- She gets extremely awkward if we're having a deep conversation unless drunk, like she'll claim it's super cringey and to stop or she'll struggle to maintain eye contact etc.

I won't lie, in the past I've put a lot of this down to her being younger than me and possibly immaturity but something popped up the other day on Facebook about Autism and straight away it's set off an alarm in my head and I'm beginning to wonder if I'm just misunderstanding her.

Can someone advise or ask me a few other things to help clarify it.",autism,1574645590,AbstruseAlan,9,1,True,2019-11-24

Why I always try to listen,"I don‚Äôt have autism. I‚Äôve met a lot of people with it and currently have friends with varying degrees though, so I feel like I understand certain aspects of it. One of these aspects is interests in specific topics. While I‚Äôm not autistic, I have a ton of things I‚Äôm passionate enough to talk about for hours with the right people. Roller coasters, Pok√©mon, Sports,  Jerseys, Flags, Music, theres a lot. I have people that I can talk to about all of that with. And if nobody else is there my girlfriend or brother will always listen. But honestly, to me there‚Äôs no shittier feeling than someone making me feel dumb about my interests and how much I can talk about them. So even though I‚Äôll never know what it‚Äôs like to have Autism, I‚Äôve always made a point to try to listen to my my friends who have it when they explain an entire musical they wrote in their head or explain the history behind the American Revolution. It may not interest me, but I never want anyone to feel bad about their interests as long as they‚Äôre harmless.

So I have an autistic coworker...,"and he is a very hard worker. however, over the past two years or so, he has become the office punching bag. i would like to list some of the reasons why before continuing...  


\+he is HOURS early to work everyday and then stands very closely behind people and watches them work because he has nothing else to do. when we ask him to stop, he will mope back to his desk like a wounded puppy and then continue to do it everyday. despite being asked to stop, yelled at and threatened, he still does it.   


\+ he will ask you the same question everyday for years and will not accept your answer. for example, he will ask me if i like football and i will tell him no. he will ask me again in a few hours. then again tomorrow, and the next day, and the next day, and the next day....eventually, ill tell him to stop asking me and he will become upset.   


\+he will force you to watch things you don't want to watch, and then be upset that you don't like it. yesterday, he wanted me to watch chiropractors on youtube. i don't like watching people get their bones cracked. he hounds me for an hour until i watch it. when i'm not impressed, he is upset with me.   


\+he often interrupts people and intrudes upon their private conversations. then he'll stand real close and offer his two cents. people are not big fans of that one.   


Basically he can't take a hint and then people become upset with him and lash out. I want to put an end to this vicious cycle, because I feel bad for him, but I don't know how to go about it. he's even getting passed by on raises by our bosses. not because of his work ethic, which is phenomenal, but because they just consider him to be annoying. i've tried talking with him about it, but he just won't listen. he insists he is always correct and won't take advice. i've tried inviting him out with us all, because he seems kind of lonely, but he doesn't have much fun as he isn't much for the party scene. i've tried framing it in a completely different light, that perhaps he should consider coming to work and doing his usual good job and forget about trying to make friends, because who needs 'em, but he just isn't responsive. He just moans ""why does everybody hate me?"" I feel awful because i'm also guilty of lashing out on him from time to time. He can be just so hard to handle some days.

Hiding from customers,"I work in a big box store.  I'm actually good with customers 95% of the time. I've worn that hat so long, I know how to fake it, and I get to demonstrate my knowledge of electrical devices.  Still, I get that knot in my stomach when I see a customer approach, even with a smile.  

Of course, when something ""off script"" happens I short-circuit.  This happens at least once most days, usually when I can't hand a customer off to someone who can deal with whatever situation.  I know that it's not the best way of addressing theses circumstances, but I usually tell the customer to stay where they are while I find someone.  If I find someone, great, if everyone else is too busy, I find somewhere to lie low for a while.   I've never had negative repercussions, as the customer will no doubt just track down the next uniformed person they see.

(a) what are your favorite forms of self-stimulation/stimming? ... and (b) what are your favorite anti-sensory devices/practices/experiences?,"**Some stimming ideas:**

(1) \[simple, portable stimming device\] affordable unisex gold-looking bracelet that can by continuously rotated for relaxation, and it never gets lost because it's just a bracelet that stays on the wrist ($10 options on Amazon, but some say that the gold-plating rubs off on some $10-bracelets if it's not removed for showering)

(2) \[simple, portable stimming device\] fidget spinner

(3) \[simple, portable stimming device\] any key fob on a lanyard for draping around the neck (for me personally, holding one end of a lanyard, and swinging my key chain forward and back on the lanyard, in front me while I walk, is far more effective than using a fidget spinner, possibly because the range of motion supplied by the lanyard swinging back and forth with the keys dangling on the end, is much wider motion than a fidget spinner seems to provide)

(4) \[auditory stimming\] listening to one favorite song over and over, on an mp3 player or smart phone

(3) \[stimming activity\] some people like walking forward for half a mile or so, and then turning back again, like on a gravel, country road ... others prefer walking in a small circle, or large circle

(4) \[comforting device\] weighted blanket

(5) \[comforting device\] weighted vest (especially weighting down the upper chest, shoulders, and upper back ... as happens during a firm hug, or even while wearing a heavy winter coat)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Ideas for anti-sensory devices/practices/experiences:**

(1) \[auditory reduction\] noise-cancelling headphones (wide price range)

(2) \[auditory reduction\] noise reduction safety ear muffs (cheap, padded headset runs about $12, non-electric, utilized for construction projects)

(3) \[visual reduction\] baseball cap, especially when the head is pointed downward, such as while walking through a busy grocery store (or otherwise experiencing a high level of sensory information)

(4) \[visual reduction\] modified baseball cap, adding flaps to both sides that drap down from the top of either side of the top of the baseball cap, creating a ""focus cap horse blinder for people"" as seen online

(5) \[visual/auditory reduction\] walking (in safe, well-lit areas only) during night, or even doing shopping in the middle of night, when everything is relatively still (this may simply not be safe in some neighborhoods, so that would not to be accounted for)

(6) \[visual reduction\] sun glasses -- it's important not to have too much tint on the sun glasses while driving, walking across the street, or in any experience where not seeing clearly could be dangerous.",autism,1574741433,INTP_Music_Man,1,1,True,2019-11-25
I think I was just banned from r/aspergirls for basically being autistic,"A little background on me. I am an adult woman who started wondering about the potential of having autism a little over a year ago and was officially diagnosed as autistic and ADHD within the past couple months.

Here‚Äôs what happened:

1. I submitted a post a few weeks ago and automod told me it was removed for using labels. I didn‚Äôt realize that the way I was phrasing things was using harmful labels because it was exactly the words a professional used to diagnose me.

2. So, I removed the label and resubmitted the post. It was removed by automod again, this time saying it that I was asking for medical advice. I was confused because I wasn‚Äôt asking for medical advice. So, I messaged the mods. They replied and explained that my post was flagged because I said it was flagged due to stating that I wondered if some of the issues I was having were due to autism and asking if people had experienced similar things. They said to not use DAE language.

3. I appreciated their response, but at that point, I did not bother trying to resubmit the post a third time because I wasn‚Äôt sure how to adjust my language in that post to fit what they wanted and still make a meaningful post that would help both myself and others. I later deleted this posts, since they never actually got posted to the subreddit.

4. Today, I tried to make another post about a different subject. I tried to be very careful with my wording. The post never showed up. If I sign out of my account, it shows as removed.

5. So, I messaged the mods about this post, thinking it was maybe stuck in a filter and wondering why. After a couple hours, I didn‚Äôt receive a reply. I went back to look at the message I had sent to them a couple weeks ago and the username of the mod who replied was no longer visible. This is when I realized that I had been banned and that the mods may not have even seen the message that I sent today.

I am a bit frustrated, which is why I‚Äôm writing about it here. As someone who was only recently diagnosed, I am still learning and I don‚Äôt have a huge support system. Getting banned from the one place that I thought ‚Äúgot it‚Äù was upsetting.

I‚Äôm frustrated because I wasn‚Äôt hostile and I wasn‚Äôt purposefully breaking the rules. I‚Äôm also frustrated because I‚Äôve seen many other posts there where people used the same or similar language to what I did in my removed posts and then were still allowed to post. I‚Äôm doubly frustrated because many autistic people have language issues and instilling such strict ban rules about language seems counterproductive and hurtful. I usually consider myself to be pretty good with language. If I was banned for not being able to conform to these rules, what about the people who struggle with language way more than me?

I‚Äôm not trying to be confrontative or cause drama. However, I want to post about this here because I think it is an important conversation to have. How strictly should language rules be enforced in subreddits devoted to autism and other things where many people struggle with language? Is it productive or helpful to autoban users who may be confused or who are looking for help?

I‚Äôm hoping this was all a misunderstanding and that I can work it out with the mods and prevent this from happening to others in the future.",autism,1574743856,_why_not_,42,1,True,2019-11-25

I just want to vent and get this off my chest...,"As an autistic woman, from my own experiences, I think many of us on the spectrum have come to know that with autism comes many challenges. The challenges can be things like being nonverbal, hypersensitivity and taking many things literally. One of the biggest challenges that we face is family and society related issues. Based on my experiences, I believe that people across the spectrum get treated very differently in society. From what I have observed, people with more severe autism tend to get treated like children, but also get a bit more understanding ( not always, but a bit more). On the other hand, people with more mild autism or Aspergers tend to get nasty replies when even a little bit of autism leaks out. These people may also be able to live independently given the right circumstance. This has lead to me believing that no matter which end you are on, it is always a struggle. It has also made me realize that people are possibly more understanding if they can see your disability. 

I think that I, for the most part, appear to have a invisible disability, which explains why I and many others on all over spectrum have been heavily bullied through school. I was originally diagnosed with autism when I was 11 but it was quickly considered a misdiagnosis. I was then diagnosed at 16. I also have dyscalclia which is a math learning disability. For years I went to doctors appointments, therapy and tutoring and my parents never explained to me once what it was all for. They didn‚Äôt even tell me about being diagnosed at 11 until about a year ago. Because of my disabilities, I spent many years being yelled at, whether it involves homework or communication. The worst part of it all was that I had a twin brother who was very obsessed with his reputation in middle school. 

When middle school had started, my brother had started to become more of a jerk, not just to me, but to other people. At this point, because I was different, I was getting bullied and it ended up getting to the point that people started to tell my brother that I was weird or other stuff like that. Because my brother became much like a self entitled popular kid, even though he treated many people that I knew poorly including the few friends that I had, he decided to tell me to my face that I‚Äôm ‚Äúruining his reputation.‚Äù I have researched much on autism and am well aware of the fact that it can have an effect on a sibling‚Äôs life. But I can‚Äôt deny that I am resentful of my brother‚Äôs behavior even though he likely didn‚Äôt know about the diagnosis. For years, my brother treated me like crap and my parents did nothing about it. ( I love my parents)My mom always came up with some excuse for his stupid behavior like hormones or too much homework. Fast forward to high school and my brother and I hardly talked to each other. Our relationship now is starting to mend itself after my brother moved out for a while. Maybe he has grown up. This is just one way that I hate how society treats us. Society is basically like ‚ÄúYeah pick on that kid over there because they are different. Also, we shouldn‚Äôt teach kids about disabilities.

One more thing I have about this society is that mental illness or disabilities seem to be glorified and ignored at the same time.

Could you speak at 3? Mom w/ OCD,"I have OCD, and my son is being assessed for autism.  Not only does this make me question my diagnosis‚Äîmaybe I actually have ASD‚Äîbut also really scares me about what the future will bring for him.

I bring my own baggage because I had a really hard time being different.  I don‚Äôt want him to suffer the way I did, but I also know that having OCD is a mental illness, while having ASD is a neurological difference, not necessarily miserable.

My biggest fear is that he won‚Äôt ever truly communicate.  He‚Äôs 3, and he speaks in mostly 2-3 word phrases, but man, I dream about having a conversation with him.  He also has some sensory and fine motor skills issues.  I have a lot of sensory problems from my disorder (especially with food), so that doesn‚Äôt scare me because I know it.

CPTSD and ASD: possible error in my psychological assessment,"As a note, I‚Äôm not looking for medical advice or a diagnosis. Rather, I‚Äôm looking for personal anecdotes or possibly shared experiences that could help me see if I‚Äôm justified in my worries, and how to best move forward.  

Recently, I got a psychological assessment done, mainly to address the question of if I‚Äôm autistic or not. The assessment was lead by a woman who has a PhD in psychology, though other psychologists were involved with the assessment, making it collaborative. 

The results were that I have ASD, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and major depression disorder in partial remission. 

The night after getting the results, I began to reflect on the procedures in the assessment and the questions that were asked. I realized that the topic of trauma seemed to be completely ignored. I indicated in the questionnaires I filled out for the assessment that I was experiencing things like flash backs, ‚Äúmysterious‚Äù health issues (which implied a psychosomatic condition), and other symptoms relevant to PTSD or CPTSD. 

This was never brought up by the assessor. No inquiry was made into my past regarding possible trauma. The focus was on anxiety and my need to pathologize myself, without questioning why I do this or when this began. 

I won‚Äôt go into detail about my past, but a lot of stuff happened, starting from childhood, which essentially led me to lose the ability to be functional, to become constantly disassociated and socially isolated/afraid of social interaction, and it fostered a deep sense of self hatred within me. I also have basically no memory of my adolescence/teen years, which is when things began to get quite bad. I lost the ability to connect with people, feel comfortable around them, feel emotions, make eye contact, etc. 

I feel that all of these symptoms have just been brushed over and then attributed to me allegedly having both social anxiety disorder and GAD, which was implied to have simply stemmed from my ASD. While I do think I‚Äôm on the spectrum, I think that the vast majority of the symptoms I‚Äôm experiencing are directly related to trauma. It took many years of therapy and residential treatments to accept that I experienced years of trauma, and now with the results of the assessment, I feel extremely insecure and lost, because I was implicitly told that what I have is anxiety stemming from ASD, not trauma. 

I‚Äôm going to meet with the assessor later this week to bring this up. But I have such a bad habit of becoming complicit and second guessing myself when in face-to-face interactions with people, that I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll just crumble and stop making sense.

What do you think of people with autism who get offended by the word disability?,"I think that an individual can choose to say that they are disabled or not, but to not call autism is a disability is just wrong. Yes autism comes with benefits, but it also comes with many more challenges. To not say it is a disability is to ignore the struggles involved. I just commented on a YouTube video about how I don‚Äôt like trans disabled people because I have autism and they are pretending to be disabled. Someone then said that calling autism a disability is offensive. Yes the word disability implies challenges, but just because someone only has a mental disorder and not a physical disability, it does not change the fact that they are still disabled. Calling autism a disability is reality and it is nothing to be ashamed of. If autism is not a disability, explain to me why we have such a hard time with daily things like eye contact, facial expression and sensory overload. Maybe it‚Äôs not physical, but just because it isn‚Äôt physical doesn‚Äôt mean it isn‚Äôt a disability. I‚Äôm on the less severe side, but to say that I‚Äôm not disabled is wrong!

Visit at the doctor,"So yesterday I (20F) went to the doctor‚Äôs for some health concerns that I had. My gp wasn‚Äôt available so they gave me an appointment with another doctor from the clinic. I was already really stressed out from going because I usually never go to appointments alone since I tend to freeze up and not communicate properly when I feel anxious but this time I went alone. So the appointment starts as normal and he goes through my file, then he sees that I‚Äôm on the autism spectrum. He proceeds to ask me if I was diagnosed by a professional. 

At that point I was a bit confused because it wouldn‚Äôt be on my file if I wasn‚Äôt, so I tell him yes. He looks at me and says: well you don‚Äôt really have the autistic features. Good for you!

I don‚Äôt know how my face reacted honestly but I was shocked and disgusted. I couldn‚Äôt believe what he had said. It felt so invalidating and really discouraging. What the hell am I supposed to be looking like to be autistic?? Am I supposed to be rolling on the floor, flapping my hands like I do when I have a meltdown?? Keep in mind I had only been in the room for less than 4 minutes at that point.

Christmas presents for a 14 year old autistic girl whom I have never met?,"I‚Äôm sorry for how scarce the details are in this post, but I haven‚Äôt been given a lot to go on. 

My family is sponsoring local kids this Christmas who‚Äôs parents can‚Äôt afford gifts for them. We each take a child and buy ‚Ç¨50 worth of presents. My mother was assigned a fourteen year old girl with autism, and we don‚Äôt know anything else about her.

My mam, who is very well meaning, has so far bought her a fluffy unicorn teddy, a fairy bath set, pyjamas, LOL dolls and some gel pens.

Autism and addiction,"Long before I knew what autism was, I knew I was ""strange.""  People told me so, pretty much every day.  Things that interested most people my age did not interest me, and I had trouble communicating or behaving ""appropriately.""  As I got older, I became laser-focused on interests that others often found odd or even childish.  My conversations tended to be monologues regarding these interests, and I roamed the school halls by myself during lunchtime.  One of my special interests was heavy metal music, so I got on OK with that crowd, but I still couldn't get the hang of small talk, flirting and the like.  

It was the headbanger contingency that introduced me to marijuana.  Initially, I found the effect soothing, and even if I still knew I was weird, I didn't care too much while I was high.  Weed even became a special interest for some time.  After several years, though, it turned on me and when I smoked I began to feel highly neurotic.  The drug that was once my means of escape came to intensify my feelings of inadequacy and isolation.  

I realized this about the time I turned 21 ( I live in the US, born in 1970), so it was a convenient time to switch from pot to alcohol.  For a long time, the booze seemed to ""work"" too.  My conversational skills did not improve, but at least I wasn't as anxious in social settings, and with a few drinks in me, my sensitivity so sensory overload or difficulties processing information seemed to diminish.  I never liked to get plastered, though every now and then I did when I misjudged how much I was ingesting.  I drank enough to feel properly medicated most of the time while still functioning, but the outcome was that I was pretty much addicted as soon as I started drinking heavily.  

 [https://network.autism.org.uk/good-practice/case-studies/autism-and-alcohol](https://network.autism.org.uk/good-practice/case-studies/autism-and-alcohol) 

Drinking that much will obviously catch up with anyone, though, and after many failed attempts at abstinence, I am now sober for almost a year.  The thing is, my autistic tendencies are more apparent, at least to me, now that the alcoholic fog has lifted.  I can't just say, ""it must be the booze"" when reviewing interactions gone wrong, for instance.  I've never been officially diagnosed, and I'm not asking for that here, but it's more obvious than ever.  Of course, I've learned to cope, fake it, put on the face, etc.  I'm high functioning, no doubt.  But there's also no doubt that I'm not NT, and I don't know what to do about it.  I just know that going back to drinking is not an option I'd ever consider.  I suppose that a diagnosis at this point would be helpful, not only for vindication, but for accommodations at work and home, since I'm not using a chemical crutch anymore.

Autistic gatekeeping,"What I've heard, mostly from actual psychological professionals: 

You can't be autistic if you:

Drive a car and are licensed to do  so.

Laugh at jokes or ever ""get"" jokes

Have a job, especially if it requires any kind of interaction with consumers

Earned a degree in anything other than computer science or the hard sciences

Experience identifiable emotions, or can control your emotions in any way

Can smile or express emotion at all

Can engage in a conversation that isn't just an information dump

Date, get married

Multitask at all

Enjoy anything beyond your special interest of the moment

I'm sure that I've forgotten some.  Drum roll, here is the best,  from the last therapist I saw a few years ago:

People with autism are just people,"Want to share this story about one of my coworkers coming to me for advice how to handle an intern who is autistic. Seriously, what advice is there to give? Everyone's different, there's no one way to deal with people or deal with autism.

My colleague was nearly in a panicked mode because she didn't know what to expect or do. So I simply told her to ask the intern what they needed from her to work efficiently, that's all. She stared at me like I invented fire and then managed to not listen to a single thing the intern requested (because she listens to no one, surprise there) and got the intern so stressed out in three days they didn't want to come anymore. 

It's so sad to me that my colleague made such a big deal out of this intern simply because they have autism. Every intern we've had so far was different to a certain degree. Just treat people like people, listen to them and leave them be. Why is it so hard for some people to act calm when coming in contact with people with autism?

respectful question about empathy from someone who's not autistic,"Sometimes I hear about autism symptoms (Are they called symptoms if they're not an illness? Let me know if there's a better word.) from allistic people, but it sounds to me like someone was observing the autistic person having the symptom without asking them about their own experience when they talk about it. I personally have some brain damage and I know when I was getting help for that I would do my best to describe an experience that I knew I'd never had before the damage, that the doctor or therapist has probably never had before as a neurotypical person, and they would constantly correct, treat, or talk about it like something they experience neurotypically without understanding how it's different. I've been told in the past by acquaintances who have autism that it's the same way with autism.

With ""empathy"", I know from my own experience that sometimes I don't have complete muscle control in my face, which makes it hard to emote in the way people expect you to and just that alone can do a number on how people perceive me in conversation. Sometimes if I'm having a really bad day with it, I can't really emotionally process things either so there have been times I've needed to talk to someone and they say something and I *should* have an empathetic emotional response but that part of my brain is just offline atm.

"How do I keep friends after school, and progress acquaintances to friends?","It‚Äôs nearing the end of my first semester of school and much like my experience during high school, I have a lot of acquaintances, but no friends, certainly no close ones. I‚Äôm just not really sure how? It‚Äôs not because I‚Äôm super shy. I‚Äôve done dating before, and I have found it much easier, despite little success, found it easier due to their being a specific process, and not just kinda expecting it to happen naturally. 

I‚Äôve seen a councillor about it, and it did kinda help with making me understand that like dating, I should have a clear goal, and make a conscious effort to achieve that goal, but I‚Äôm still confused how to apply that.

So my question is, how do I progress from, occasionally talking when we see each other at school, and texting each other about HW and notes, to being actual friends?

I apologized and spent the rest of the meeting trying to manage what I hope was a more serious-looking face.

He says he doesn't put himself out there because of being a shy introvert but I also wonder if he's socially awkward which it sounds like.

Seeking Olfactory Overload Advice,"Hello,

So, I want to preface by saying that I'm not diagnosed with autism, though I suspect that I could have what was formerly Asperbergers and have sensory issues, especially regarding smell, and I'm in the process of seeking evaluation. I don't mean to offend the community, but I wanted to ask advice on how people handle situations that are similar to the one that I will describe below. 

So I've been a vegetarian since I was 4. I freaked out one day at McDonald's when I realized what meat was made of and just stopped eating meat altogether from that day onward. I'm really sensitive about meat, and the more something looks like the animal, the more freaked out I am by meat. Therefore, I really hate holidays like Thanksgiving because of the turkey carcass. Not only that, but the smell is so overpowering that I want to vomit and this sensation has only gotten worse as I got older. The gag reflex when I even THINK of the smell is so strong that I started to feel like I was going to throw up when I was telling my therapist about this issue. Also, my family uses an electric carver, which makes gross and awful noises that set me off. I have suspected that my sensitivity is due to sensory stuff, but I'm not sure and haven't talked to someone who specializes in this area to know for sure just yet. 

Anyways, I can mostly get past the visual overload and the hearing overload, but the smell of the turkey is the one that I can't get past. It's very overwhelming, but I don't want to miss Thanksgiving, especially because my grandma is getting older. How do others deal with smell overload? Thank you for advice.

My thoughts on THANKSGIVING with two amazing boys on the AUTISM SPECTRUM,"Help a sister or friend with a spectrum child‚ù§Ô∏èüß©

Thanksgiving is a time to eat and celebrate for most families.  For parents of children with Autism, even the ones that appear ‚Äúnormal‚Äù on the outside thanksgiving and gathering for meals outside of the home can be very very stressful.  These are ways you can help ease some of that stress if you happen to be lucky enough to have a spectrum family on your guest list.
1. Do cook your normal meal but maybe have some kid favorites stashed just in case .  Chicken nuggets are a big one.  Ask the family if you can help in any way, likely mom and dad will come prepared!
2. DO NOT AND I REPEAT DO NOT QUESTION THE CHILD/TEEN ABOUT WHAT THEY ARE EATING!  You will ostracize them and make them feel even more odd than they already feel, you will make mom and dad uncomfortable, and you will make yourself look dumb.  Get a book if your family member has a need and read about it.  Eating is probably the most common childhood problem with kids on the spectrum.
3. Don‚Äôt comment on the parents weight, the parents ‚Äútired‚Äù look or any dysfunction you observe.  The parents will be tired for the rest of their life.  Mom and dad may be too skinny, too chubby, drink too much coffee, alcohol, or engage in some other behavior you deem unfit but for them it‚Äôs coping!  They don‚Äôt have time to worry about their weight or water intake they are in damage control mode.  Make them a pot of coffee, offer to babysit and be thankful you can learn from them.  God only gives special children to the ones who can handle it.  I personally spent the first years of both of my children‚Äôs lives counting calories.  Not for myself but for them, scared out of my mind they would die from nutritional deficit.    I never slept, looked like a toothpick and chain smoked.  Parents like me live in an out of control environment.  Sometimes that makes us very controlling by nature because they are grasping to control any one thing.  This too is okay. 
4. Do not make the comment ‚Äúthey‚Äôll eat when they are hungry‚Äù.  Basically in reference to leaving food in front of them until they starve.  Kids on the spectrum will starve to death before they eat a food that is not acceptable to their sensory needs.  It will pass.
5. DO offer help.  Break out the tissues.  Likely mom or dad is On The brink of tears.  It‚Äôll be okay but they don‚Äôt know it yet.  Be that person that they remember was the one person who didn‚Äôt make them feel worse than they do.  Be that friend who has chicken nugget boxes at the thanksgiving table.  Have a pair of earphones or plugs for the child to have quiet when they need it.  I promise you that friend will be treasured for the rest of their lives.  
6. Remember this family experiences judgement every single second of every day if they are out of the safety of their home.  Be the safe place. Be thankful.  Likely you‚Äôll learn lessons from the family that are so precious you cannot even imagine!

I can now safely say I‚Äôve make it out alive on the other side of the circus.  My boys and their little quirks remind me how far we‚Äôve come.  Today we will be thankful no matter what‚Äôs on the menu.  Thankful to be a family and have food and a place to stay warm.  We will celebrate all of our family traditions and we won‚Äôt dress up or eat formally.  Dressing up requires itchy clothes, that‚Äôs a whole other article;)
Feel free to stop on by, we‚Äôll have the chicken nuggets on standby‚ù§Ô∏èüß©

I've been struggling with my autism lately,"Hello. I'm an autistic teenage girl with autism. I've made posts on here before, but today, there's a lot to get out my mind. 

Today at dinner, I was eating bacon cream cheese pasta my mother had made. I love the dish, but usually, we have chorizo. Mum started saying that I usually do not like spicy things. This is true, but I have never noticed chorizo was spicy, and was upset this made her change the meal, so I let her know I like chorizo. I have never been able to control my tone, and mum thought I was criticising her meal, and I later found out this was one of two reasons, and the other was she went to a smaller shop than usual. 

Next, I ran out of my juice, then tried to take a sip. Mum told me to go get a drink, but I didn't need it that much and said I would be fine. Then I coughed because I have a sore throat, and mum told me she would not get a drink for me. I really did not want to get up at this point, but I was confused because I never asked mum to get me a drink. 

My tone made mum upset, and so she did not let me have dessert. I thought because in my mind I had done nothing wrong, this was unfair. Mum then explains that people say sorry when they have made others think something is not what they meant, but I say it is her fault because she made the mistake. I know I might be in the wrong here, but I find it very hard to say sorry to someone when I do not know or cannot control what I have done wrong, it's like saying sorry to my bullies. 

I have talked to her about this, and she understands what I meant. But it's really hard when in my mind I'm getting punished for something I did not do. I rely a lot on energy foods such as dessert after tea to power me through my incredibly tiring days, and if there's any advice on that too, it would be very welcome.

Now ik this seems like a harmless thing, but me and my mom proceeded to but heads and she at one point tells me that she‚Äôs going to have sex with my dad. The thing is that I struggle to have the courage to bring a girl home in general it never happens. I try to talk my mom to make up telling her about my sleep problems, she tells me ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you get a girlfriend but she can‚Äôt stay the night here‚Äù. Now to all you parents that do this to your kid, FUCK YOU to the highest degree. I talked to my therapist about this briefly and I left out certain parts and I‚Äôm going to tell her the full story. 
 
Do any of your parents do this to emotionally scar you in to fear that you can‚Äôt bring a girl/guy over. I stand by my side, but do any of you think this is a major problem to ruin your child‚Äôs self esteem like that?",autism,1574971792,harveydent19,0,1,True,2019-11-28
How to deal with that bad feeling when you realise that you have been awkward?,"So recently I have been to dentist for first time in +5 years. I am petrified of dentists because of traumatic experience I have went through. During moments like this I get even more socially awkward and sometimes even unable to communicate.


The appointment was just about cleaning my teeth but it was still painful and super scary. Afterwards it was just a roller-coaster of awkwardness. After appointment I went to reception to pay for treatment and this lady at reception looked at me, her pc screen and then at  me again followed by looking at her friend again. There was something in the way she looked at her friend as if to point out that there was something wrong with me. I don't know what it was about but it made me feel very self conscious.


I felt so stressed from everything that I just left right after paying. I forgot I meant to meet with my 'career' (it's clinic for people who feel anxious about going to dentist so they help patients to get through their treatment) and it just made me feel even more awkward.


Now this is weighting down on me. How would you guys deal with situation like this? And if you go through awkward situation like this, how do you deal with these feelings of just being awkward person?",autism,1574975663,sad-mustache,3,1,True,2019-11-28
Just had my first love experience!,"First off: my autism is strange and the way I think is particularly rational, particularly emotional (in the way the NT's do.)

The Story: On Friday night I realised it: I (16,M) have feelings for my best friend (16,F) I don't know how that happened but it was as if someone flipped a hormone switch.
After a lot of thinking and being anxious I wrote her a text message about my feelings on Sunday night.
As expected, I got rejected, because:
First: I think we're best friends for so long that she just could not see me as a love interest.
Second: (and by far more obvious) She's lesbian.
She told me nothing changed for her (people do ship us since 6th grade) so I was really glad our friendship survived.
Saw her at work the day after and it wasn't fine at all, seeing her, talking to her, it really was a strange feeling i had all the time, it was really bittersweet.
As I was back home I wrote her that I'd need distance and time to get over it.
A few hours later I had a emotional overload and wrote her that I might have to end the friendship, even though I didn't want it, I just couldn't stand that feeling anymore.
We wrote for quite a while and I cried a lot while we did, I think she probably cried too.
The outcome was that I wanted to keep radio silence until we meet on Friday, also I pushed her into the double role of being my best friend who helps me get through this as well as the person I love.
The next day I realised that I was able to control these feelings much more than the day before.
I broke the radio silence for once and wrote her that I'll stay her best friend but that I love her regardless, also that I hope that this feeling won't go away at all because, this feeling, this incredibly strong feeling, is so much at once, so much beauty and so much pain, I wanted to keep it. 
Fast to days later (now): The feeling is gone. Completely. I don't want this feeling to be gone.
But I'm glad at some point because that way everything can get back to normal.
But i don't want it to be gone.
Because that way the feeling I had the last month came back; a feeling of emptiness. A feeling of not having a purpose to exist, of not having found my place, of having any use.

Anyways, I'll see my best friend tomorrow and see how this turns out.",autism,1574981384,Lukivanknobi,1,1,True,2019-11-28

Kind of a touchy question...,"Has anyone tried CBD for sleep issues in their children with autism? I know this is not the conventional way but we are very concerned with our 3 year old‚Äôs sleep patterns and are not pleased with the advice from the pediatrician. 
We run a tight ship with a solid evening/bedtime routine that our girl does excellent with. She‚Äôs perfect with her routine right up until she just doesn‚Äôt fall asleep... for 5+ hours sometimes. 
Other times she will fall asleep almost immediately but wake back up at midnight and be ready to start her day. She will be wound all up as if she got a full night‚Äôs sleep. She can keep a routine of this for a week. Getting no more that 3-4 hours a sleep in 24 hours. She looks like hell but she‚Äôs her happy, go-getter self. After a stent of this we may go back to a lovely, ideal 8pm-6am for a few weeks. The doc wanted to start a daily regiment of melatonin and anti-anxiety medication before bed. We are kinda hippies and aren‚Äôt really into medicating a 3 year old who is not anxious, and melatonin is a hormone and can effect how she develops her abilities to make this later. Also the intermittent changes make me feel like it needs to be a remedy that can be used sometimes and not in the long glorious stents of good sleep.

Dad is always working to care for mom, even when she doesn't need it. So neither of my parents tends to give a shit and when they do it's to my other two brothers. So here I am, just alone constantly with no friends and no close family.

A question for everyone.,"I've seen several posts where people mention how their parents never acknowledged their autism or revealed it to them.

As a parent to a 4 yr old little boy I can't imagine ever doing this to him. But now the question is:

How, or when, do you tell your children that they're altruistic?

Even though my son is still young and mostly scripting/speaking in Echolalia, I cannot tell how much he is aware of the fact that he is different.

He's had moments where he's been left completely dumbfounded by some other kid's behavior/reaction in which I've had to swoop in and sooth and reassure him. So I'm sure it's starting to become more apparent to him.

I talk to him, but since he's still not able to express what he thinks and feels I'm still left wondering what registers and what doesn't...but I keep doing it anyway.

Nobody who‚Äôd ever invite me anywhere. People I‚Äôve tried being friendly with seem to literally avoid me and try to ghost me.

Dating Advice?,"Hey everyone,

New to this subreddit, firstly, a bit of background about me:

Male
28
Australian
Diagnosed with autism aged 4
Work as a software tester
Live on my own

Since I moved out earlier this year, my new main goal in life is to find a girlfriend. Most ladies I know in the age range I'm looking for in a girlfriend (21-30) tend to be taken or married already, and my existing social activities don't provide much opportunity to meet any sadly, so I thought I'd try online dating (eHarmony). I don't  mention my autism in my prpfile. So far, I've had four dates, here's how each of them went:

1 - Conversation didn't flow that well as later dates, we still enjoyed each other's company over dinner, she didn't feel much of a romantic bond when I contacted her the following day, and let me know upfront. Was able to tell I was autistic as well.

2 - We talked on the dating site for a good few days before me met, met for dinner (we were going to go bowling, but she injured herself playing sports), things seemed to go well, we ended up talking for 3 hours, talking was around 70-30 to her (so I did most of the listening), she even brought up politics (something I wouldn't do on a first date), but 15 minutes after hugging and swapping numbers, she blocked me on eHarmony. I felt really gutted that night and barely slept.

3 - Talked for a week before meeting at an arcade, we switched to texting before meeting, no ghosting afterwards, and the conversation continued for a few days afterwards, but then fizzled out one day - I had the last word, and never heard from her again.

4 - Had some of the best conversations (virtually any time we weren't respectively working/occupied/sleeping we were chatting) for over a week before meeting for bowling, we had a great time bowling everything from strikes to gutterballs, and had a fair bit of common (she even liked my favourite TV show), this was then followed by another 3 hour chat over coffee. I mentioned I'd like to see her again when we parted ways, and we talked for a few days afterwards before she suddenly stopped responding. My phone played up a little as well, so I sent one more on eHarmony to double check, after the third attempt I moved on (got the message). Felt quite crummy after that.

A few other things about me:

I still find it a little hard to make friends, but am very good at keeping them once I've made friends (it takes me 5+ hours to write all my Christmas cards)

I have several good female friends (one of whom actually invited me to her hens/bachelorette party a couple of years ago), and some of whom I've known for many years, one since early in high school.

People who know me will tell you I'm reliable, dependable, honest, loyal, and hard working.

A good (female) friend of mine mentioned that (at least 4 years ago) my eyes twitch a little when I talk. Maybe this could be part of the turn off?

All advice is welcome, and I'm  happy to ask any questions to help. I had next to no dating experience before this year (for a few reasons), have done a lot of research (about dos and don'ts) and asked friends though. As I don't want to keeping doing the same thing and wondering why things aren't working, I thought I'd ask for tips

I tend to minimize my own accomplishments; for instance, I have a master‚Äôs degree and work as a teacher, but in an environment with a lot of personal freedom and very little accountability, and so I sort of discount myself as a professional. My job is hanging out with kids all day and teaching a subject I love. There are no production quotas. No commissions. No sales goals. Often, I‚Äôve thought ‚ÄúIf you had to work in the private sector, or any sector where success was quantifiable, you wouldn‚Äôt make it.‚Äù

Some good news,"This is probably going to be a long one so hold on.

In the UK, you need a statement or EHCP (educational healthcare plan) to be accepted by certain schools and to get more support from the council, teachers and professionals. The problem is it's hard. Real hard. While I was in primary school my mother ( who has absolutely incredible) tried 4 times to get out of my current primary school after the times I was picked on and beaten up for being 'weird'. Some teachers thought I was lying or I was just sensitive because I'm high functioning and did well in school. 2 tries 2 appeals for absolutely nothing.

Then secondary school comes along. I was beaten up twice in my first 5 weeks for letting down the sports team (I'm also dyspraxic so I have no hand eye coordination). Teachers did nothing. Boys in year nine every day threw stones, bottles, books, pens and pencils, food and cups at me nearly every day soaking my clothes and making go to class looking disgusting with food and drink all down me. Teachers did nothing.
I had been threatened with being stabbed, acid and actually had drinks poured on my head while I was treated as setting them off so it was my fault. READING A BOOK IN THE LIBRARY ISN'T SETTING ANY OFF MS. ODELL!  

But then I just snapped. Since February I haven't been back and the new Senco ( person at the school who's supposed to help disabled children) doesn't really care. But then my mum got a solicitor. And managed to get an educational psychologist to review me, my mum also got a councillor for both of us - first one wasn't that great but my one now is excellent- and followed up every phone call every email every letter to get support for her and me. 

Then finally we get a phone call. We got it. The council reviewed me and got it! Any secondary school in the county have to take me and the school has to provide transport. But it's not over yet. To save money the government are going to try to get into mainstream and in our town so they don't need to give us anything, but we've been fighting so long why would we just give in now? It's been a tough, nightmarish few months but we can see the light at the end of tunnel, just a few more months.

How many of you are adult and still on dexamfetamine? I think i may have been having side effects for years (F26),"Hi, 

I just send my doctor a long email with what i think are side effect of dexamfetamine. 
Headache, muscle aches, less sleep, hallucinations while waking up, dry mouth, cold hand and feet, stress. 

Did any of you have those? 

I read online that you get dexamfetamine for ADHD and Narcolepsy. I have neither, i have Pdd-nos. 
Also that longterm taking it and above 18 is not recommended/ common. 

I have not seen a shrink for over 5 years. I think i am still taking them because the primary physicians just thought ‚Äúokay, dunno why but she gets them for so long already lets just keep giving them‚Äù.

Problem is, i started taking these against stress and to get more energy.

One of my biggest regrets, or rather just a dumb moment, was in 8th grade when a girl in my class said I was one of her favorite people and asked if I liked chinese food.

Struggling to enter the WorkForce,"As the title says I've been having a hard time entering the 'workforce'. I'm 18 now and have been expected to have a job since I was 16. When I start looking at job listings or thinking about it I'm overcome with what I'm guessing is fear. It feels similar to when I have a panic attack but not as sharp, if that makes sense? I keep second-guessing if its fear or excitement or both, or maybe something completely different. I don't know what I want to do with my life, I don't want to mess up and commit to the wrong career. I know I have many years to figure it out and what my family thinks doesn't really matter but it doesn't make the feeling go away. I feel so helpless and lost when I try to do anything related to 'growing up'. My mind blanks and I just don't know anything. I don't know what I write where, how I'm supposed to answer things, what is expected of me, and so on. My comfort zone changes so rapidly I don't know what work I'd be comfortable with. Some days I'm fine with dealing with people, or at least able to push the negatives to the back of my mind. Other days I can't leave my room out of fear of seeing my family and having to interact with them. I enjoy animals but don't think I want to work with them mostly because of the type of people that come with it. I can't do math, period. I use a calculator for even simple things and am very slow about figuring problems out. I don't know what kind of learner I am I just know I'm not very good at it. Physically I struggle to carry out basic tasks. I've torn so many muscles in my shoulders that I can't lift very much, every joint in my legs is abnormally weak, my scoliosis cripples me after 45 minutes of standing, asthma makes it impossible to breath most days, nerve damage in the ears has reduced my hearing, the list just keeps going. I haven't been able to get my licenses and constantly forget simple things when driving I know its an accident waiting to happen. My GPA in school was sickeningly low, I didn't even hit 2.0 and my teachers took pity on me and rounded my grades up so I could graduate. Sometimes I think I just wasn't programmed to survive.

Reverb / Resonance in a room,"Hello all. Its my first post here, and frankly, since my diagnosis as a 30 year old male, a few months ago, this sub has been cathartic in my own personal acceptance. It's relieving to feel a little less alone about my triggers and uncomfortabilities which many of us share.

One of these is reverb. It's something which overwhelms me in a room which has more than a well furnished room in a small home. I can barely tolerate my own voice or movements. I notice it also in YouTube videos, or voice recordings. Perhaps a positive is I that I feel I can describe the room's composition from its reverb, but that's just because I'm totally focused on it and I certainly don't focus on the speaking subject...

In a whimsical frustration, I always have enjoyed minimal, large, open spaces - I've dreamed of a loft-style apartment with concrete wall and tall ceilings. But damn, whenever I see these luxury homes on TV, I don't feel too awful that I don't live in one - how could they cope!? The joys of a NT :)",autism,1575074685,DomUK89,6,1,True,2019-11-29

Bizarre dreams and sleeping issues,"I have a lot of trouble sleeping at night and I have to have music playing so I don't have a lucid nightmare in which I kill myself in some new way. I get a maximum of 6 hours sleep and I wake up at least 3 times during the night. I've had this issue for a very long time but I didn't know where to take it as my parents don't think it's a doctors worthy issue and that it might just waste the doctors time and ours.

My dreams are always wild. Last night for example I dreamed of going to prom but there was 4 different rooms. One room had a bunch of tables. One had a forest and minecraft stuff. One had a beach. One was locked. A bunch of people I know went into the room with the tables and took drugs and the couples went to the beach room. I stayed in the hallway where there was some random tables. Needless to say by the end of the dream I had been stabbed 12 times in the same spot by the drug users and a creeper blew up in front of me. Then I ran out and parkoured down some stairs and then i woke up.

My dreams are often lucid so I have control over what happens but sometimes I lose control and it ends with me shooting myself or some other method of death. Then I wake up with sleep paralysis and I feel a little sick.

I need to know if this is just a ""me problem"" or if you guys suffer from bizarre dreams and sleep issues too.",autism,1575108762,CodeyA6969,11,1,True,2019-11-30

How do I make my mum understand what autism is?,"Hello!!
I'm 16 and was diagnosed with asd about a month ago. The diagnosis has really helped me understand myself and my relationships with others better. For example, why my parents have never really understood me. I thought that maybe after getting the diagnosis, they would be willing to learn more about it so we could understand each other better, but I was wrong. I live with my mum and she is really ableist and it's very hard for me to put up with it. I am very sensitive to light and due to that, I wear sunglasses everywhere. I started doing that this summer, because I didn't have the confidence for it before, my mother immediately had a problem with it. She said that it's weird and how would I feel if everyone started going around naked because it's comfortable for them. I tried to explain it to her, but she continued to not listen to me and when I had a panic attack and started crying hysterically and even then she said that I'm being ""too much"". After months, she's finally left me alone about it, but she still makes fun of my sunglasses occasionally. I also have very bad auditory processing and I'm sensitive to loud unexpected sounds. For example, a few days ago she started vacuuming without me knowing and vacuuming sounds are very painful to me. I tried to listen to music on full volume but I could still hear the vacuum and it was horrible so after she was done I asked if she could warn me next time she vacuums. She said that I should be grateful that anyone is vacuuming at all and that I'm the one who needs to get it under control. I really don't know what to do with her, there have been countless other instances like that, for example when I can't hear her and ask her to repeat herself she just doesn't say anything and ignores me or gets mad about it. One time she was like ""Do we have to learn sign language or something?"" and I replied that it would be really helpful for me indeed and that I want to learn sign language, but she just dismissed that. What should I do? I feel absolutely horrible all the time and she won't listen to me about anything that has to do with MY sensory issues..",autism,1575113236,bamgeez,17,1,True,2019-11-30

Autism identity,"Hey, sorry this may be a rambling post, so bear with me. 


I work in a ASD class for kids aged 4-11. When I started one of my colleagues said they don‚Äôt mention autism in front of the kids, because most of them don‚Äôt know they have autism and we shouldn‚Äôt tell them because it would be pointing out that they‚Äôre different.

And I agreed, but recently been questioning this opinion. Does avoiding talking about autism just back up the idea that it‚Äôs not ok to be autistic? The class exists within a mainstream school and I do often have kids from other classes ask me why some kids are in our class but they‚Äôre not. And I never know what to say, if I‚Äôm not allowed to talk about autism. 

The kids I work with will eventually have to know they‚Äôre autistic. They‚Äôre not going to be able to go their whole lives not knowing (Well most anyway).
